    abstract = "{See Coulthard and Knight (doi:10.1093/aww335) for a scientific commentary on this article.Individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease clinical diagnoses can display significant phenotypic heterogeneity. This variability likely reflects underlying genetic, environmental and neuropathological differences. Characterizing this heterogeneity is important for precision diagnostics, personalized predictions, and recruitment of relatively homogeneous sets of patients into clinical trials. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging cohort (ADNI) to elucidate the heterogeneity of neuroanatomical differences between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 530) and Alzheimer’s disease (n = 314) and cognitively normal individuals (n = 399), thereby adding to an increasing literature aiming to establish neuroanatomical and neuropathological (e.g. amyloid and tau deposition) dimensions in Alzheimer’s disease and its prodromal stages. These dimensional approaches aim to provide surrogate measures of heterogeneous underlying pathologic processes leading to cognitive impairment. We relate these neuroimaging patterns to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, white matter hyperintensities, cognitive and clinical measures, and longitudinal trajectories. We identified four such atrophy patterns: (i) individuals with largely normal neuroanatomical profiles, who also turned out to have the least abnormal cognitive and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles and the slowest clinical progression during follow-up; (ii) individuals with classical Alzheimer’s disease neuroanatomical, cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and clinical profile, who presented the fastest clinical progression; (iii) individuals with a diffuse pattern of atrophy with relatively less pronounced involvement of the medial temporal lobe, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 values, and proportionally greater executive impairment; and (iv) individuals with notably focal involvement of the medial temporal lobe and a slow steady progression, likely representing in early Alzheimer’s disease stages. These four atrophy patterns effectively define a 4-dimensional categorization of neuroanatomical alterations in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease that can complement existing dimensional approaches for staging Alzheimer’s disease using a variety of biomarkers, which offer the potential for enabling precision diagnostics and prognostics, as well as targeted patient recruitment of relatively homogeneous subgroups of subjects for clinical trials.}",

abstract = {A hallmark feature of vertebrate brain organization is ordered topography, wherein sets of neuronal connections preserve the relative organization of cells between two regions. Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.}

@article{bron_ten_2022,
abstract = {Machine learning methods exploiting multi-parametric biomarkers, especially based on neuroimaging, have huge potential to improve early diagnosis of dementia and to predict which individuals are at-risk of developing dementia. To benchmark algorithms in the field of machine learning and neuroimaging in dementia and assess their potential for use in clinical practice and clinical trials, seven grand challenges have been organized in the last decade: MIRIAD (2012), Alzheimer's Disease Big Data DREAM (2014), CADDementia (2014), Machine Learning Challenge (2014), MCI Neuroimaging (2017), TADPOLE (2017), and the Predictive Analytics Competition (2019). Based on two challenge evaluation frameworks, we analyzed how these grand challenges are complementing each other regarding research questions, datasets, validation approaches, results and impact. The seven grand challenges addressed questions related to screening, clinical status estimation, prediction and monitoring in (pre-clinical) dementia. There was little overlap in clinical questions, tasks and performance metrics. Whereas this aids providing insight on a broad range of questions, it also limits the validation of results across challenges. The validation process itself was mostly comparable between challenges, using similar methods for ensuring objective comparison, uncertainty estimation and statistical testing. In general, winning algorithms performed rigorous data pre-processing and combined a wide range of input features. Despite high state-of-the-art performances, most of the methods evaluated by the challenges are not clinically used. To increase impact, future challenges could pay more attention to statistical analysis of which factors (i.e., features, models) relate to higher performance, to clinical questions beyond Alzheimer's disease, and to using testing data beyond the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Grand challenges would be an ideal venue for assessing the generalizability of algorithm performance to unseen data of other cohorts. Key for increasing impact in this way are larger testing data sizes, which could be reached by sharing algorithms rather than data to exploit data that cannot be shared. Given the potential and lessons learned in the past ten years, we are excited by the prospects of grand challenges in machine learning and neuroimaging for the next ten years and beyond.},

This was the best-performing method in recent crowdsourcing benchmark study, DREAM Alzheimer's Disease Big Data challenge to predict changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores over 24-months using standardized data. In the present study, we conducted three additional analyses beyond the DREAM challenge question to improve the clinical contribution of our approach, including: (1) adding pre-validated baseline cognitive composite scores of ADNI-MEM and ADNI-EF, (2) identifying subjects with significant declines in MMSE scores and (3) incorporating SNPs of top 10 genes connected to APOE identified from functional-relationship network. For (1) above, we significantly improved predictive accuracy, especially for the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) group. For (2), we achieved an area under ROC of 0.814 in predicting significant MMSE decline: our model has 100% precision at 5% recall and 91% accuracy at 10% recall. For (3), “genetic only” model has Pearson's correlation of 0.15 to predict progression in the MCI group. Even though addition of this limited genetic model to COMPASS did not improve prediction of progression of MCI group, the predictive ability of SNP information extended beyond well-known APOE allele.},

abstract = {Introduction
The objective of this study was to estimate longitudinal changes in disease progression (measured by Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive 11-item [ADAS-cog/11] scale) after bapineuzumab treatment and to identify covariates (demographics or baseline characteristics) contributing to the variability in disease progression rate and baseline disease status.
Methods
A population-based disease progression model was developed using pooled placebo and bapineuzumab data from two phase-3 studies in APOE ε4 noncarrier and carrier Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
Results
A beta regression model with the Richard's function as the structural component best described ADAS-cog/11 disease progression for mild-to-moderate AD population. This analysis confirmed no effect of bapineuzumab exposure on ADAS-cog/11 progression rate, consistent with the lack of clinical efficacy observed in the statistical analysis of ADAS-cog/11 data in both studies. Assessment of covariates affecting baseline severity revealed that men had a 6\% lower baseline ADAS-cog/11 score than women; patients who took two AD concomitant medications had a 19\% higher (worse) baseline score; APOE ε4 noncarriers had a 5\% lower baseline score; and patients who had AD for a longer duration had a higher baseline score. Furthermore, shorter AD duration, younger age, APOE ε4 carrier status, and use of two AD concomitant medications were associated with faster disease progression rates. Patients who had an ADAS-cog/11 score progression rate that was not statistically significantly different from 0 typically took no AD concomitant medications.
Discussion
The beta regression model is a sensible modeling approach to characterize cognitive decline in AD patients. The influence of bapineuzumab exposure on disease progression measured by ADAS-cog/11 was not significant.

A mathematical model was developed to describe the longitudinal response in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Methods
The model was fit to the longitudinal ADAS-cog scores from 817 patients. Risk factors (age, apolipoprotein ɛ4 [APOE ɛ4] genotype, gender, family history of AD, years of education) and baseline severity were tested as covariates.
Results
Rate of disease progression increased with baseline severity. Age, APOE ɛ4 genotype, and gender were identified as potential covariates influencing disease progression. The rate of disease progression in patients with mild to moderate AD was estimated as approximately 5.5 points/yr.
Conclusions
A disease progression model adequately described the natural decline of ADAS-cog observed in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Baseline severity is an important covariate to predict a curvilinear rate of disease progression in normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients. Age, APOE ɛ4 genotype, and gender also influence the rate of disease progression.}

Of 210 new patients attending a memory clinic, 139 fulfilled inclusion criteria and comprised dementia (n = 115) and nondementia (n = 24) groups. The composite and the component scores on the ACE for the two groups were compared with those of 127 age- and education-matched controls. Norms and the probability of diagnosing dementia at different prevalence rates were calculated. To evaluate the ACE{\textquoteright}s ability to differentiate early AD from FTD, scores of the cases diagnosed with dementia with a Clinical Dementia Rating \&lt; 1 (AD = 56, FTD = 24, others = 20) were compared.Results: Two cut-off values for the ACE composite score (88 and 83) were of optimal utility depending on the target population. The ACE had high reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity (93\%, using 88 as cut-off). Using the lower cut-off of 83, the ACE had a higher sensitivity (82\%) and predictive value than the Mini-Mental State Examination for a wide range of dementia prevalence. The ACE differentiated AD from FTD, and the VLOM ratio (derived using component scores: [verbal fluency + language]/[orientation + memory]) of \&lt;2.2 for FTD and \&gt;3.2 for AD was highly discriminating.Conclusion: The ACE is a brief and reliable bedside instrument for early detection of dementia, and offers a simple objective index to differentiate AD and FTD in mildly demented patients.},

This might be the inference of percent changes in blood flow in perfusion FMRI data, segmentation of subcortical structures from structural MRI, or inference of the probability of an anatomical connection between an area of cortex and a subthalamic nucleus using diffusion MRI. In this article we will describe how Bayesian techniques have made a significant impact in tackling problems such as these, particularly in regards to the analysis tools in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). We shall see how Bayes provides a framework within which we can attempt to infer on models of neuroimaging data, while allowing us to incorporate our prior belief about the brain and the neuroimaging equipment in the form of biophysically informed or regularising priors. It allows us to extract probabilistic information from the data, and to probabilistically combine information from multiple modalities. Bayes can also be used to not only compare and select between models of different complexity, but also to infer on data using committees of models. Finally, we mention some analysis scenarios where Bayesian methods are impractical, and briefly discuss some practical approaches that we have taken in these cases.}

ABSTRACT = {Skull stripping in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential step to analyze images of the brain. Although manual segmentation has the highest accuracy, it is a time-consuming task. Therefore, various automatic segmentation algorithms of the brain in MRI have been devised and proposed previously. However, there is still no method that solves the entire brain extraction problem satisfactorily for diverse datasets in a generic and robust way. To address these shortcomings of existing methods, we propose the use of a 3D-UNet for skull stripping in brain MRI. The 3D-UNet was recently proposed and has been widely used for volumetric segmentation in medical images due to its outstanding performance. It is an extended version of the previously proposed 2D-UNet, which is based on a deep learning network, specifically, the convolutional neural network. We evaluated 3D-UNet skull-stripping using a publicly available brain MRI dataset and compared the results with three existing methods (BSE, ROBEX, and Kleesiek&rsquo;s method; BSE and ROBEX are two conventional methods, and Kleesiek&rsquo;s method is based on deep learning). The 3D-UNet outperforms two typical methods and shows comparable results with the specific deep learning-based algorithm, exhibiting a mean Dice coefficient of 0.9903, a sensitivity of 0.9853, and a specificity of 0.9953.},

Cortical gray matter volume and abnormal white matter volume also made independent contributions to performance in 4 of 5 cognitive domains assessed by the MDRS. Regional analysis indicated that limbic cortical gray matter volume and nonlimbic cortical gray matter volume were also correlated with the MDRS score; however, in the regression analysis the individual gray matter measures were not independently associated with MDRS performance. A similar analysis revealed statistically independent relationships of limbic gray matter volume and abnormal white matter volume, but not nonlimbic cortical gray matter volume, to Mini-Mental State Examination performance.\\ Quantitative magnetic resonance methods provided strong evidence that cortical gray matter volume, which may reflect atrophy, and abnormal white matter volume are independently related to dementia severity in probable Alzheimer disease: lower gray matter and higher abnormal white matter volumes are associated with more severe dementia.}

Although there is currently no cure, it is possible to treat symptoms of dementia. Early diagnosis is paramount to the development and success of interventions, and neuroimaging represents one of the most promising areas for early detection of AD. We aimed to deploy advanced deep learning methods to determine whether they can extract useful AD biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and classify brain images into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) groups. We tailored and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on sMRIs of the brain from datasets available in online databases. Our proposed method, ADNet, was evaluated on the CADDementia challenge and outperformed several approaches in the prior art. The method's configuration with machine-learning domain adaptation, ADNet-DA, reached 52.3% accuracy. Contributions of our study include devising a deep learning system that is entirely automatic and comparatively fast, presenting competitive results without using any patient's domain-specific knowledge about the disease. We were able to implement an end-to-end CNN system to classify subjects into AD, MCI, or CN groups, reflecting the identification of distinctive elements in brain images. In this context, our system represents a promising tool in finding biomarkers to help with the diagnosis of AD and, eventually, many other diseases.}

abstract = {The neuroimaging community has witnessed a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery from using traditional univariate brain mapping approaches to multivariate predictive models, allowing the field to move toward a translational neuroscience era. Regression-based multivariate models (hereafter “predictive modeling”) provide a powerful and widely used approach to predict human behavior with neuroimaging features. These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data, opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling, which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next, we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function, symptom severity, personality traits, and emotion processing. Finally, we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data, longitudinal prediction, external validations, and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature, as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.}

abstract = {Abstract Background Mild Cognitive Impairment defines a transitional stage between normal ageing and dementia, and reflects the clinical situation where a person has memory complaints and objective evidence of cognitive impairment but no evidence of dementia. To plan the care of patients with MCI, it is important to predict as accurately as possible potential risk factors modulating the conversion to AD. Aim To investigate the risk factors associated of conversion to dementia of Alzheimer type (AD) for subjects with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). Methods and Materials One hundred nineteen subjects consecutively recruited who met the operational criteria for aMCI (with or without deficits in other cognitive domains). They underwent multidimensional assessment and a neuropsychological battery at baseline and at follow-up, after 1 year. Diagnosis for dementia was based on a deficit in two or more cognitive domains severe enough to affect the participant functional abilities. Subjects converted to AD over time were classified as Demented; subjects that remained unchanged, or became cognitively normal during follow-up, were defined as Stable. Results Demented MCI (N = 40; 33.6\%) were older (mean age 73.5 ± 8.5 vs. 69.2 ± 7.0; p = 0.006) when compared to Stable (N = 79; 66.4) and their global cognitive performances, at baseline, were more compromised when assessed by ADAS-Cog (mean score 10.7 ± 3.9 vs 6.7 ± 3.4; p = .000) and by MMSE (mean score 26.1 ± 1.9 vs. 27.3 ± 1.8; p = 0.002). Demented were similarly compromised in basic activities of daily living (BADL mean 0.2 ± 0.4 vs 0.1 ±  0.3 functions lost; p = NS) but more compromised on instrumental daily functions (IADL mean 0.7 ± 0.8 vs. 0.1 ± 0.5 functions lost; p = 0.001). The presence of white matter lesions (WML) on CT or MRI was more pronounced in Demented group (p = 0.02). After 1 year; Demented worsened on phonemic verbal fluency (PFL) (p = 0.009), Raven's coloured matrices (p = 0.003), Trail Making test A and B (p = 0.008 and p = 0.007 respectively) and in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) (p =0 .000) respect to Stable. Logistic regression analysis revealed that ADAS-Cog basal score, Trail Making B, IADL but not memory deterioration were significantly associated to the conversion to AD. Conclusions In subjects with aMCI poor global cognitive performance at baseline, the worsening on executive functions and on functional status but not the worsening on memory functions are independently associated with the conversion to dementia of Alzheimer type at 1 year, follow-up.

Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set, properties of the 11-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.11), the 13-item ADAS-cog (ADAS.All) and novel composite scores were compared, using weighting schemes derived from the Random Forests (RF) tree-based multivariate model. Weighting subscores using the RF model of ADAS.All enhanced discrimination between elderly controls, MCI and AD patients. The ability of the RF-weighted ADAS-cog composite and individual scores, along with neuroimaging or biochemical biomarkers to predict MCI to AD conversion over 12 months was also assessed. Although originally optimized to discriminate across diagnostic categories, the ADAS. All, weighted according to the RF model, did nearly as well or better than individual or composite baseline neuroimaging or CSF biomarkers in prediction of 12-month conversion from MCI to AD. These suggest that a modified subscore weighting scheme applied to the 13-item ADAS-cog is comparable to imaging or CSF markers in prediction of conversion from MCI to AD at 12 months.}

We selected longitudinal data from the ADNI database to investigate how well normal function (HC, n= 134) vs. conversion to MCI (cMCI, n= 134) and stable MCI (sMCI, n=333) vs. conversion to AD (cAD, n= 333) could be predicted from cognitive tests, and whether the predictions improve by adding information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Features representing trajectories of change in the selected cognitive and MRI measures were derived from mixed effects models and used to train ensemble machine learning models to classify the pairs of subgroups based on a subset of the data set. Evaluation in an independent test set showed that the predictions for HC vs. cMCI improved substantially when MRI features were added, with an increase in [Formula: see text]-score from 60 to 77%. The [Formula: see text]-scores for sMCI vs. cAD were 77% without and 78% with inclusion of MRI features. The results are in-line with findings showing that cognitive changes tend to manifest themselves several years after the Alzheimer's disease is well-established in the brain.}

The local approach, contrary to existing global methods, provides spatial information on anatomical patterns of brain ageing. We trained a U-Net model using brain MRI scans from n=3463 healthy people (aged 18-90 years) to produce individualised 3D maps of brain-predicted age. When testing on n=692 healthy people, we found a median (across participant) mean absolute error (within participant) of 9.5 years. Performance was more accurate (MAE around 7 years) in the prefrontal cortex and periventricular areas. We also introduce a new voxelwise method to reduce the age-bias when predicting local brain-age {\textquotedblleft}gaps{\textquotedblright}. To validate local brain-age predictions, we tested the model in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia using data from OASIS3 (n=267). Different local brain-age patterns were evident between healthy controls and people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly in subcortical regions such as the accumbens, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus and amygdala. Comparing groups based on mean local brain-age over regions-of-interest resulted in large effects sizes, with Cohen{\textquoteright}s d values \&gt;1.5, for example when comparing people with stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment. Our local brain-age framework has the potential to provide spatial information leading to a more mechanistic understanding of individual differences in patterns of brain ageing in health and disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Another application of such methods is to predict clinical scores from individual scans. Using relevance vector regression (RVR), we predicted individuals' performances on established tests from their MRI T1 weighted image in two independent data sets. From Mayo Clinic, 73 probable AD patients and 91 cognitively normal (CN) controls completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) within 3months of their scan. Baseline MRI's from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) comprised the other data set; 113 AD, 351 MCI, and 122 CN subjects completed the MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale—Cognitive subtest (ADAS-cog) and 39 AD, 92 MCI, and 32 CN ADNI subjects completed MMSE, ADAS-cog, and AVLT. Predicted and actual clinical scores were highly correlated for the MMSE, DRS, and ADAS-cog tests (P<0.0001). Training with one data set and testing with another demonstrated stability between data sets. DRS, MMSE, and ADAS-Cog correlated better than AVLT with whole brain grey matter changes associated with AD. This result underscores their utility for screening and tracking disease. RVR offers a novel way to measure interactions between structural changes and neuropsychological tests beyond that of univariate methods. In clinical practice, we envision using RVR to aid in diagnosis and predict clinical outcome.}

ABSTRACT = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE1) and apolipoproteins (APOs) may play important roles in the development of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study aimed to examine the associations of AD, CVD, and endocrine-metabolic diseases (EMDs) with the levels of ACE1 and 9 APO proteins (ApoAI, ApoAII, ApoAIV, ApoB, ApoCI, ApoCIII, ApoD, ApoE, and ApoH). Non-Hispanic white individuals including 109 patients with AD, 356 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 373 CVD, 198 EMD and controls were selected from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Multivariable general linear model (GLM) was used to examine the associations. ApoE \&epsilon;4 allele was associated with AD, as well as ApoAIV, ApoB and ApoE proteins, but not associated with CVD and EMD. Both AD and CVD were associated with levels of ACE1, ApoB, and ApoH proteins. AD, MCI and EMD were associated with levels of ACE1, ApoAII, and ApoE proteins. This is the first study to report associations of ACE1 and several APO proteins with AD, MCI, CVD and EMD, respectively, including upregulated and downregulated protein levels. In conclusion, as specific or shared biomarkers, the levels of ACE1 and APO proteins are implicated for AD, CVD, EMD and ApoE \&epsilon;4 allele. Further studies are required for validation to establish reliable biomarkers for these health conditions.},

Backpropagation was the first computationally efficient model of how neural networks could learn multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled training data and it did not work well in deep networks. The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain top-down connections and training them to generate sensory data rather than to classify it. Learning multilayer generative models might seem difficult, but a recent discovery makes it easy to learn nonlinear distributed representations one layer at a time.}

  abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

    abstract = { Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts the final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or neither at fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET of the brain and compare its performance to that of radiologic readers. Materials and Methods Prospective 18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90\% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10\%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95\% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82\% specificity at 100\% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57\% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91\% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82\% specificity at 100\% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

	abstract = {Beyond detecting brain lesions or tumors, comparatively little success has been attained in identifying brain disorders such as Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD), based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Here we aimed to build a practical brain imaging-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. We pooled MRI data from more than 217 sites/scanners to constitute the largest brain MRI sample to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants). Next, we applied a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, to build a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9\% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD. After transfer learning, the model fine-tuned for AD classification achieved 91.3\% accuracy in leave-sites-out cross-validation on the Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 94.2\%/87.9\% accuracy for direct tests on two unseen independent datasets (AIBL/OASIS). When this AD classifier was tested on brain images from unseen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, MCI patients who finally converted to AD were 3 times more likely to be predicted as AD than MCI patients who did not convert (65.2\% vs 20.6\%). Predicted scores from the AD classifier showed significant correlations with illness severity. In sum, the proposed AD classifier could offer a medical-grade biomarker that could be integrated into AD diagnostic practice. Our trained model, code and preprocessed data are freely available to the research community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
