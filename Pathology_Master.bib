abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by stereotyped origination and spread pattern of epileptogenic activity, which is reflected in stereotyped topographic distribution of neuronal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both epileptogenic activity and atrophy spread appear to follow white matter connections. We model the networked spread of activity and atrophy in TLE from first principles via two simple first order network diffusion models. Atrophy distribution is modeled as a simple consequence of the propagation of epileptogenic activity in one model, and as a progressive degenerative process in the other. We show that the network models closely reproduce the regional volumetric gray matter atrophy distribution of two epilepsy cohorts: 29 TLE subjects with medial temporal sclerosis (TLE-MTS), and 50 TLE subjects with normal appearance on MRI (TLE-no). Statistical validation at the group level suggests high correlation with measured atrophy (R = 0.586 for TLE-MTS, R = 0.283 for TLE-no). We conclude that atrophy spread model out-performs the hyperactivity spread model. These results pave the way for future clinical application of the proposed model on individual patients, including estimating future spread of atrophy, identification of seizure onset zones and surgical planning.},

abstract = {The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion MRI and resting state fMRI. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their fMRI data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the physiological functions of Abeta, as well as the primary mechanisms that initiate early Abeta-mediated synaptic dysfunctions, remain largely unknown. Here we examine the acute effects of endogenously released Abeta peptides on synaptic transfer at single presynaptic terminals and synaptic connections in rodent hippocampal cultures and slices. Increasing extracellular Abeta by inhibiting its degradation enhanced release probability, boosting ongoing activity in the hippocampal network. Presynaptic enhancement mediated by Abeta was found to depend on the history of synaptic activation, with lower impact at higher firing rates. Notably, both elevation and reduction in Abeta levels attenuated short-term synaptic facilitation during bursts in excitatory synaptic connections. These observations suggest that endogenous Abeta peptides have a crucial role in activity-dependent regulation of synaptic vesicle release and might point to the primary pathological events that lead to compensatory synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease.},

Due to AD's complex etiology and pathogenesis, an effective and medically practical solution is a challenging task. In this paper, we developed and evaluated two novel hybrid deep learning architectures for AD progression detection. These models are based on the fusion of multiple deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models. The first architecture is an interpretable multitask regression model that predicts seven crucial cognitive scores for the patient 2.5 years after their last observations. The predicted scores are used to build an interpretable clinical decision support system based on a glass-box model. This architecture aims to explore the role of multitasking models in producing more stable, robust, and accurate results. The second architecture is a hybrid model where the deep features extracted from the BiLSTM model are used to train multiple machine learning classifiers. The two architectures were comprehensively evaluated using different time series modalities of 1371 subjects participated in the study of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The extensive, real-world experimental results over ADNI data help establish the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed deep learning models.},

abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks. Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing.},

Here we present a high-throughput method to identify the spatial origin of cells assayed by single-cell RNA-sequencing within a tissue of interest. Our approach is based on comparing complete, specificity-weighted mRNA profiles of a cell with positional gene expression profiles derived from a gene expression atlas.

abstract = {Recent imaging evidence in Alzheimer's disease suggests that neural involvement in early-stage disease is more complex than is encapsulated in the commonly held position of predominant mesial temporal lobe degeneration-there is also early posterior cingulate cortex and diencephalic damage. These findings suggest that early clinical Alzheimer's disease is underpinned by damage to an inter-connected network. If correct, this hypothesis would predict degeneration of the white matter pathways that connect this network. This prediction can be tested in vivo by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Most diffusion tensor imaging studies of white matter in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease have concentrated on fractional anisotropy reductions and increased 'apparent' diffusivity; however, there is a lack of empirical biological evidence to assume that fractional anisotropy changes will necessarily capture the full extent of white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, therefore, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of diffusion behaviour in Alzheimer's disease by analysing each of the component eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor in isolation to test the hypothesis that early Alzheimer's disease is associated with degeneration of a specific neural network. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we performed voxel-wise analyses of fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivities in 25 Alzheimer's disease patients compared with 13 elderly controls. We found that increased absolute (axial, radial and mean) diffusivities in Alzheimer's disease were concordant in a distribution consistent with the network hypothesis, highly statistically significant and far more sensitive than fractional anisotropy reductions. The former three measures identified confluent white matter abnormalities in parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulum, extending laterally into adjacent temporo-parietal regions as well as splenium and fornix. The caudal occipital lobe, temporal pole, genu and prefrontal white matter were relatively preserved. This distribution is highly consistent with expected predictions of tract degeneration from grey matter lesions identified by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Concordant with results from these other imaging modalities, this pattern predominantly involves degeneration of the tracts connecting the circuit of Papez. These findings also highlight that early neuropathological processes are associated with changes of the diffusion ellipsoid that are predominantly proportional along all semi-principal axes.},

Thirteen bvFTD and 20 PPA patients were studied. Tract-based spatial statistics and voxel-based morphometry were used. Patients with bvFTD showed widespread diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT MRI) abnormalities affecting most of the WM bilaterally. In PPA patients, WM damage was more focal and varied across the 3 syndromes: left frontotemporoparietal in nonfluent, left frontotemporal in semantic, and left frontoparietal in logopenic patients. In each syndrome, DT MRI changes extended beyond the topography of gray matter loss. Left uncinate damage was the best predictor of frontotemporal lobar degeneration diagnosis versus controls. DT MRI measures of the anterior corpus callosum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus differentiated bvFTD from nonfluent cases. The best predictors of semantic PPA compared with both bvFTD and nonfluent cases were diffusivity abnormalities of the left uncinate and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. This study provides insights into the similarities and differences of WM damage in bvFTD and PPA variants. DT MRI metrics hold promise to serve as early markers of WM integrity loss that only at a later stage may be detectable by volumetric measures.},

Voxel-based morphometry was performed by using statistical parametric mapping. The epsilon4 allele frequency was higher in the AD group (P < 0.001) than the controls but not in the bvFTD group. No differences in demographic or cognitive profiles were observed between epsilon4 allele carriers and noncarriers within any of the diagnostic groups. However, epsilon4 carrier status was associated with more severe brain atrophy in disease-specific regions compared with noncarriers in both AD and bvFTD. AD epsilon4 carriers showed greater atrophy in the bilateral parietal cortex and right hippocampus, and bvFTD epsilon4 carriers demonstrated greater atrophy in the bilateral medial, dorsolateral, and orbital frontal cortex, anterior insula, and cingulate cortex with right predominance. This regional epsilon4 effect is consistent with the hypothesis that apoE may affect the morphologic expression uniquely in different neurodegenerative diseases. The atrophy patterns in epsilon4 carriers may indicate that they are at greater risk for clinical progression.},

abstract = {Intracellular inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated filamentous tau are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease and other sporadic neurodegenerative tauopathies. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that tau aggregates do not only seed further tau aggregation within neurons, but can also spread to neighbouring cells and functionally connected brain regions. This process is referred to as ‘tau propagation' and may explain the stereotypic progression of tau pathology in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Here, we describe a novel in vivo model of tau propagation using human P301S tau transgenic mice infused unilaterally with brain extract containing tau aggregates. Infusion-related neurofibrillary tangle pathology was first observed 2 weeks post-infusion and increased in a stereotypic, time-dependent manner. Contralateral and anterior/posterior spread of tau pathology was also evident in nuclei with strong synaptic connections (efferent and afferent) to the site of infusion, indicating that spread was dependent on synaptic connectivity rather than spatial proximity. This notion was further supported by infusion-related tau pathology in white matter tracts that interconnect these regions. The rapid and robust propagation of tau pathology in this model will be valuable for both basic research and the drug discovery process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of amyloid deposition in a clinically unimpaired elderly population, as assessed by Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and its relationship to cognitive function, measured with a battery of neuropsychological tests. DESIGN: Subjects underwent cognitive testing and PiB PET imaging (15 mCi for 90 minutes with an ECAT HR+ scanner). Logan graphical analysis was applied to estimate regional PiB retention distribution volume, normalized to a cerebellar reference region volume, to yield distribution volume ratios (DVRs). SETTING: University medical center. PARTICIPANTS: From a community-based sample of volunteers, 43 participants aged 65 to 88 years who did not meet diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional PiB retention and cognitive test performance. RESULTS: Of 43 clinically unimpaired elderly persons imaged, 9 (21%) showed evidence of early amyloid deposition in at least 1 brain area using an objectively determined DVR cutoff. Demographic characteristics did not differ significantly between amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative participants, and neurocognitive performance was not significantly worse among amyloid-positive compared with amyloid-negative participants. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid deposition can be identified among cognitively normal elderly persons during life, and the prevalence of asymptomatic amyloid deposition may be similar to that of symptomatic amyloid deposition. In this group of participants without clinically significant impairment, amyloid deposition was not associated with worse cognitive function, suggesting that an elderly person with a significant amyloid burden can remain cognitively normal. However, this finding is based on relatively small numbers and needs to be replicated in larger cohorts. Longitudinal follow-up of these subjects will be required to support the potential of PiB imaging to identify preclinical Alzheimer disease, or, alternatively, to show that amyloid deposition is not sufficient to cause Alzheimer disease within some specified period.},

Much has been learned about the molecular genetics of Huntington's disease and the possible effects of the trinucleotide expansion in the development of this disease and other neurological disorders. The Huntington's disease locus is widely expressed throughout the brain and in many non-neural tissues. Current speculation about the pathogenesis of neuronal death concentrates on a 'gain of function' effect in which the abnormal protein has acquired a new and lethal property. Future research will define the normal function of the Huntington's disease locus, test hypotheses regarding the putative gain of function, and explore the factors that determine neuronal susceptibility to the effects of the abnormal allele. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The microtubule assembly-promoting activity of different pools of tau protein isolated from Alzheimer disease (AD) and control brains and the effect of dephosphorylation on this activity were studied. Tau isolated from a 2.5% perchloric extract of AD brain had almost the same activity as that obtained from control brain, and this activity did not change significantly on dephosphorylation. Abnormally phosphorylated tau (AD P-tau) isolated from brain homogenate of AD patients had little activity, and upon dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, its activity increased to approximately the same level as the acid-soluble tau. Addition of AD P-tau to a mixture of normal tau and tubulin inhibited microtubule assembly. AD P-tau bound to normal tau but not to tubulin. These studies suggest that the abnormal phosphorylation of tau might be responsible for the breakdown of microtubules in affected neurons in AD not only because the altered protein has little microtubule-promoting activity but also because it interacts with normal tau, making the latter unavailable for promoting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules.},

abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer disease and accumulates in neurons undergoing neurofibrillary degeneration. In the present study, the associations of the Alzheimer-hyperphosphorylated tau (AD P-tau) with the high molecular weight MAPs (HMW-MAPs) MAP1 and MAP2 were investigated. The AD P-tau was found to aggregate with MAP1 and MAP2 in solution. The association of AD P-tau to the MAPs resulted in inhibition of MAP-promoted microtubule assembly. However, unlike the coaggregation of AD P-tau and normal tau, the association between AD P-tau and the HMW-MAPs did not result in the formation of filaments/tangles. The affinity of the tau–AD P-tau association was higher than that of HMW-MAPs–AD P-tau because normal tau inhibited the latter binding. The association between AD P-tau and the HMW-MAPs also appeared to occur in situ because these proteins cosedimented from the Alzheimer brain extracts, and, in the sediment, the levels of the HMW-MAPs correlated with the levels of AD P-tau. These studies suggested that the abnormally phosphorylated tau can sequester both normal tau and HMW-MAPs and disassemble microtubules but, under physiological conditions, can form tangles of filaments only from tau.},

Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

abstract = {This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Topics addressed include incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, health expenditures and costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society. The report also explores issues that arise when people with AD and other dementias live alone. The characteristics, risks, and unmet needs of this population are described. An estimated 5.4 million Americans have AD, including approximately 200,000 age <65 years who comprise the younger-onset AD population. Over the coming decades, the aging of the baby boom generation is projected to result in an additional 10 million people with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, there is expected to be one new case of AD every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and AD prevalence is projected to be 11 million to 16 million. Dramatic increases in the number of "oldest-old" (those age ≥85 years) across all racial and ethnic groups are expected to contribute to the increased prevalence of AD. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Although the proportions of deaths due to other major causes of death have decreased in the last several years, the proportion due to AD has risen significantly. Between 2000 and 2008, the proportion of deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased by 13%, 20%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion due to AD increased by 66%. In 2011, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.4 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $210 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. In 2012, payments for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with AD and other dementias are expected to be $200 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 800,000 people with AD (one in seven) live alone, and up to half of them do not have an identifiable caregiver. People with dementia who live alone are exposed to risks that exceed the risks encountered by people with dementia who live with others, including inadequate self-care, malnutrition, untreated medical conditions, falls, wandering from home unattended, and accidental deaths.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by A$\beta$ overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation. We report that an early, transient and site-specific AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser262 and Thr231 epitopes is temporally and causally related with an activation of the endogenous amyloidogenic pathway that we previously reported in hippocampal neurons undergoing cell death upon NGF withdrawal [Matrone, C., Ciotti, M.T., Mercanti, D., Marolda, R., Calissano, P., 2008b. NGF and BDNF signaling control amyloidogenic route and Ab production in hippocampal neurons. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 105, 13138-13143]. Such tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as apoptotic death, is (i) blocked by 4G8 and 6E10 A$\beta$ antibodies or by specific $\beta$ and/or $\gamma$-secretases inhibitors; (ii) temporally precedes tau cleavage mediated by a delayed (6-12h after NGF withdrawal) activation of caspase-3 and calpain-I; (iii) under control of Akt-GSK3$\beta$-mediated signaling. Finally, we show that such site-specific tau hyperphosphorylation causes tau detachment from microtubules and an impairment of mitochondrial trafficking. These results depict, for the first time, a rapid interplay between endogenous A$\beta$ and tau post-translational modifications which act co-ordinately to compromise neuronal functions in the same neuronal system, under physiological conditions as seen in AD brain.},

abstract = {The automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease plays an important role in human health, especially in its early stage. Because it is a neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer's disease seems to have a long incubation period. Therefore, it is essential to analyze Alzheimer's symptoms at different stages. In this paper, the classification is done with several methods of machine learning consisting of K -nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), linear discrimination analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF). Moreover, novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is presented to diagnose Alzheimer's severity. The relationship between Alzheimer's patients' functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images and their scores on the MMSE is investigated to achieve the aim. The feature extraction is performed based on the robust multitask feature learning algorithm. The severity is also calculated based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score, including low, mild, moderate, and severe categories. Results show that the accuracy of the KNN, SVM, DT, LDA, RF, and presented CNN method is 77.5%, 85.8%, 91.7%, 79.5%, 85.1%, and 96.7%, respectively. Moreover, for the presented CNN architecture, the sensitivity of low, mild, moderate, and severe status of Alzheimer patients is 98.1%, 95.2%,89.0%, and 87.5%, respectively. Based on the findings, the presented CNN architecture classifier outperforms other methods and can diagnose the severity and stages of Alzheimer's disease with maximum accuracy.},

abstract = {The prion-like transsynaptic propagation of misfolded tau along the brain's connectome has previously been modeled using connectome-based network diffusion models. In addition to the connectome, interactions between the general neurological “milieu” in the neurodegenerative brain and proteinopathic species can also contribute to pathology propagation. Such a molecular nexopathy framework posits that the distinct characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders stem from interactions between the network and surrounding molecular players. However, the effects of these modulators remain unquantified. Here, we present Nexopathy in silico (“Nex is ”), a quantitative model of tau progression augmenting earlier models by including parameters of pathology propagation defined by the molecular modulators of connectome-based spread. Our Nex is :microglia model provides the first quantitative characterization of this effect on the whole brain by expanding previous models of neuropathology progression by incorporating microglial influence. We show that Trem2 , but not microglial homeostasis genes, significantly improved the model's predictive power. Trem2 appears to reduce tau accumulation rate while increasing its interregional spread from the hippocampal seed area, causing higher tau burden in the striatum, pallidum, and contralateral hippocampus. Nex is provides an improved understanding and quantification of microglial contribution to tau propagation and can be flexibly modified to include other modulators of progressive neurodegeneration.},

Still, these techniques are attractive to use when examining complex tissue specimens with diverse cell populations, where complete expression profiles are required to properly capture their richness. Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. To illustrate the capacity of our method, we use data from different experimental platforms and spatially map cell types from the mouse brain and developmental heart, which arrange as expected.},

abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the different characteristics of tau seeding and spreading following intracerebral inoculation in murine models of tau-enriched fractions of brain homogenates from AD and other tauopathies. The present study is centered on the importance of host tau in tau seeding and the molecular changes associated with the transformation of host tau into abnormal tau. The brains of three adult murine genotypes expressing different forms of tau—WT (murine 4Rtau), hTau (homozygous transgenic mice knock-out for murine tau protein and heterozygous expressing human forms of 3Rtau and 4Rtau proteins), and mtWT (homozygous transgenic mice knock-out for murine tau protein)—were analyzed following unilateral hippocampal inoculation of sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from the same AD and control cases. The present study reveals that (a) host tau is mandatory for tau seeding and spreading following tau inoculation from sarkosyl-insoluble fractions obtained from AD brains; (b) tau seeding does not occur following intracerebral inoculation of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from controls; (c) tau seeding and spreading are characterized by variable genotype-dependent tau phosphorylation and tau nitration, MAP2 phosphorylation, and variable activation of kinases that co-localize with abnormal tau deposits; (d) transformation of host tau into abnormal tau is an active process associated with the activation of specific kinases; (e) tau seeding is accompanied by modifications in tau splicing, resulting in the expression of new 3Rtau and 4Rtau isoforms, thus indicating that inoculated tau seeds have the capacity to model exon 10 splicing of the host mapt or MAPT with a genotype-dependent pattern; (e) selective regional and cellular vulnerabilities, and different molecular compositions of the deposits, are dependent on the host tau of mice injected with identical AD tau inocula.},

abstract = {A shared neuropathological feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy is the development of intracellular aggregates of $\alpha$-synuclein that gradually engage increasing parts of the nervous system. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these neurodegenerative disorders, however, are unknown. Several studies have highlighted similarities between classic prion diseases and these neurological proteinopathies. Specifically, identification of Lewy bodies in fetal mesencephalic neurons transplanted in patients with Parkinson's disease raised the hypothesis that $\alpha$-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, could be transmitted from the host brain to a graft of healthy neurons. These results and others have led to the hypothesis that a prion-like mechanism might underlie progression of synucleinopathy within the nervous system. We review experimental findings showing that misfolded $\alpha$-synuclein can transfer between cells and, once transferred into a new cell, can act as a seed that recruits endogenous $\alpha$-synuclein, leading to formation of larger aggregates. This model suggests that strategies aimed at prevention of cell-to-cell transfer of $\alpha$-synuclein could retard progression of symptoms in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the recent terminology for patients with cognitive deficiencies in the absence of functional decline. Most patients with MCI harbor the pathologic changes of AD and demonstrate transition to dementia at a rate of 10% to 15% per year. Patients with AD and MCI experience progressive brain atrophy. OBJECTIVE To analyze the structural magnetic resonance imaging data for 24 patients with amnestic MCI and 25 patients with mild AD using an advanced 3-dimensional cortical mapping technique. DESIGN Cross-sectional cohort design. Patients/ METHODS We analyzed the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 24 amnestic MCI (mean MMSE, 28.1; SD, 1.7) and 25 mild AD patients (all MMSE scores, >18; mean MMSE, 23.7; SD, 2.9) using an advanced 3-dimensional cortical mapping technique. RESULTS We observed significantly greater cortical atrophy in patients with mild AD. The entorhinal cortex, right more than left lateral temporal cortex, right parietal cortex, and bilateral precuneus showed 15% more atrophy and the remainder of the cortex primarily exhibited 10% to 15% more atrophy in patients with mild AD than in patients with amnestic MCI. CONCLUSION There are striking cortical differences between mild AD and the immediately preceding cognitive state of amnestic MCI. Cortical areas affected earlier in the disease process are more severely affected than those that are affected late. Our method may prove to be a reliable in vivo disease-tracking technique that can also be used for evaluating disease-modifying therapies in the future.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, ranks third in health care cost after heart disease and cancer. Given the disproportionate aging of the population in all developed countries, the socio-economic impact of AD will continue to rise. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional state between normal aging and dementia, carries a four- to sixfold increased risk of future diagnosis of dementia. As complete drug-induced reversal of AD symptoms seems unlikely, researchers are now focusing on the earliest stages of AD where a therapeutic intervention is likely to realize the greatest impact. Recently neuroimaging has received significant scientific consideration as a promising in vivo disease-tracking modality that can also provide potential surrogate biomarkers for therapeutic trials. While several volumetric techniques laid the foundation of the neuroimaging research in AD and MCI, more precise computational anatomy techniques have recently become available. This new technology detects and visualizes discrete changes in cortical and hippocampal integrity and tracks the spread of AD pathology throughout the living brain. Related methods can visualize regionally specific correlations between brain atrophy and important proxy measures of disease such as neuropsychological tests, age of onset or factors that may influence disease progression. We describe extensively validated cortical and hippocampal mapping techniques that are sensitive to clinically relevant changes even in the single individual, and can identify group differences in epidemiological studies or clinical treatment trials. We give an overview of some recent neuroimaging advances in AD and MCI and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the various analytic approaches.},

The effects of DBS are not limited to the targeted structure, but will affect the distributed anatomical networks to which the target structure belongs. Therefore, understanding the anatomical connections of the PPN will help elucidate treatment effects. Furthermore, establishing the topography of cortical and sub-cortical connections of the PPN in the human brain could aid accurate targeting of critical pathways in DBS. This article summarizes the connections of the PPN and the distribution of these connections within this nucleus (topography) as previously determined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy human volunteers and in a primate Macaca mulatta brain. These findings highlight DTI as a useful tool for surgical targeting for DBS of the PPN, and also show that DTI can be used to accurately probe the anatomy of the human and monkey brain in vivo.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common surgical therapy for Parkinson' s disease (PD). DBS of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is emerging as a promising surgical therapy for PD as well. In order to better characterize these nuclei in humans, we determined the anatomical connections of the PPN and STN and the topography of these connections using probabilistic diffusion tractography. Diffusion tractography was carried out in eight healthy adult subjects using diffusion data acquired at 1.5 T MRI (60 directions, b=1000 s/mm(2), 2 x 2 x 2 mm(3) voxels). The major connections that we identified from single seed voxels within STN or PPN were present in at least half the subjects and the topography of these connections within a 36-voxel region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. Both the PPN and STN showed connections with the cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and down the spinal cord, largely matching connections demonstrated in primates. The topography of motor and associative brain areas in the human STN was strikingly similar to that shown in animals. PPN Topography has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, but we showed significant topography of cortical and subcortical connections in the human PPN. In addition to demonstrating the usefulness of PDT in determining the connections and topography of small grey matter structures in vivo, these results allow for inference of optimal DBS target locations and add to our understanding of the role of these nuclei in PD.},

The mechanisms driving this organization are poorly understood. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in twins, we identify a major role for genes, showing that they preferentially influence connectivity strength between network hubs of the human connectome. Using transcriptomic atlas data, we show that connected hubs demonstrate tight coupling of transcriptional activity related to metabolic and cytoarchitectonic similarity. Finally, comparing over thirteen generative models of network growth, we show that purely stochastic processes cannot explain the precise wiring patterns of hubs, and that model performance can be improved by incorporating genetic constraints. Our findings indicate that genes play a strong and preferential role in shaping the functionally valuable, metabolically costly connections between connectome hubs.},

Using the unbiased single cell sequencing method Drop-seq, we report that concussive TBI affects previously undefined cell populations, in addition to classical hippocampal cell types. TBI also impacts cell type-specific genes and pathways and alters gene co-expression across cell types, suggesting hidden pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic target pathways. Modulating the thyroid hormone pathway as informed by the T4 transporter transthyretin Ttr mitigates TBI-associated genomic and behavioral abnormalities. Thus, single cell genomics provides unique information about how TBI impacts diverse hippocampal cell types, adding new insights into the pathogenic pathways amenable to therapeutics in TBI and related disorders.},

We developed an adeno-associated virus-based model exhibiting rapid tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus in 4 weeks. We found that depleting microglia dramatically suppressed the propagation of tau and reduced excitability in the dentate gyrus in this mouse model. Moreover, we demonstrate that microglia spread tau via exosome secretion, and inhibiting exosome synthesis significantly reduced tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that microglia and exosomes contribute to the progression of tauopathy and that the exosome secretion pathway may be a therapeutic target.},

The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become one of the most popular MRI techniques in brain research, as well as in clinical practice. The number of brain studies with DTI is growing steadily and, over the last decade, has produced more than 700 publications. Diffusion tensor imaging enables visualization and characterization of white matter fascicli in two and three dimensions. Since the introduction of this methodology in 1994, it has been used to study the white matter architecture and integrity of the normal and diseased brains (multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, dementia, schizophrenia, etc.). Although it provided image contrast that was not available with routine MR techniques, unique information on white matter and 3D visualization of neuronal pathways, many questions were raised regarding the origin of the DTI signal. Diffusion tensor imaging is constantly validated, challenged, and developed in terms of acquisition scheme, image processing, analysis, and interpretation. While DTI offers a powerful tool to study and visualize white matter, it suffers from inherent artifacts and limitations. The partial volume effect and the inability of the model to cope with non-Gaussian diffusion are its two main drawbacks. Nevertheless, when combined with functional brain mapping, DTI provides an efficient tool for comprehensive, noninvasive, functional anatomy mapping of the human brain. This review summarizes the development of DTI in the last decade with respect to the specificity and utility of the technique in radiology and anatomy studies.},

abstract = {The stepwise progression of tau pathology [NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) and NTs (neuropil threads)] in AD (Alzheimer's disease) is generally assumed to begin in the transentorhinal region (entorhinal stage) from which it progresses to the hippocampus (limbic stage) and to neocortical regions (neocortical stage). This stepwise progression is reflected in the NFT Braak stages. However, it has been shown recently that tau pathology is frequently seen in subcortical nuclei, in particular the LC (locus coeruleus) in over 90% of individuals under 30 years of age, suggesting that AD-associated tau pathology begins in the LC and not in the transentorhinal region. On the other hand, only minimal amounts of tau pathology are seen in the LC in cases with considerable entorhinal tau pathology, while the severity of tau pathology in the LC significantly increases with increasing NFT Braak stages. These findings suggest that the LC becomes increasingly involved during AD progression rather than representing the site initially affected. Further studies are warranted to answer the question of whether tau pathology in the LC of young individuals is associated with AD or whether it rather reflects non-specific neuronal damage.},

abstract = {We use a new, unsupervised multivariate imaging and analysis strategy to identify related patterns of reduced white matter integrity, measured with the fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and decreases in cortical thickness, measured by high resolution T1-weighted imaging, in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This process is based on a novel computational model derived from sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) that allows us to automatically identify mutually predictive, distributed neuroanatomical regions from different imaging modalities. We apply the SCCA model to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or CSF-biomarker-diagnosed AD (n=24) and FTD (n=25) with both DTI and T1-weighted structural imaging. SCCA shows that the FTD-related frontal and temporal degeneration pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected p<0.0005. In AD, we find significant association between cortical thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed parietal and temporal network (p<0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within SCCA identified regions-significant differences exist between FTD and AD cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. We conclude that SCCA is a potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

abstract = {A hallmark feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is that symptoms appear to spread along neuroanatomical pathways to engulf the motor nervous system, suggesting a propagative toxic entity could be involved in disease pathogenesis. Evidence for such a propagative entity emerged recently in studies using mice that express G85R-SOD1 mutant protein fused to YFP (G85R-SOD1:YFP). Heterozygous G85R-SOD1:YFP transgenic mice do not develop ALS symptoms out to 20 months of age. However, when newborns are injected with spinal homogenates from paralyzed mutant SOD1 mice, the G85R-SOD1:YFP mice develop paralysis as early as 6 months of age. We now demonstrate that injecting spinal homogenates from paralyzed mutant SOD1 mice into the sciatic nerves of adult G85R-SOD1:YFP mice produces a spreading motor neuron disease within 3.0 ± 0.2 months of injection. The formation of G85R-SOD1:YFP inclusion pathology spreads slowly in this model system; first appearing in the ipsilateral DRG, then lumbar spinal cord, before spreading rostrally up to the cervical cord by the time mice develop paralysis. Reactive astrogliosis mirrors the spread of inclusion pathology and motor neuron loss is most severe in lumbar cord. G85R-SOD1:YFP inclusion pathology quickly spreads to discrete neurons in the brainstem and midbrain that are synaptically connected to spinal neurons, suggesting a trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded protein. Taken together, the data presented here describe the first animal model that recapitulates the spreading phenotype observed in patients with ALS, and implicates the propagation of misfolded protein as a potential mechanism for the spreading of motor neuron disease.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), a putative pathogenic endotoxin involved in Alzheimer's disease, induces redistribution of glutamate transporters in astrocytes and promotes their pump activity. Because the transporters are assumed to protect neurons against excitotoxicity by removing extracellular glutamate, we hypothesized that Abeta alters the vulnerability of neurons to glutamate. Cerebrocortical neuron-astroglial co-cultures were exposed to glutamate, the concentration of which was selected so that only 20% of the neurons exhibited degeneration. When cultures were pre-treated with Abeta, exposure to the same "mild" glutamate concentration failed to damage neurons. The Abeta-induced protection was abolished by a glial glutamate transporter inhibitor. Thus, Abeta can alleviate excitotoxicity through glutamate transporter activity. The present results may challenge prevailing concepts that Abeta-induced neuron loss causes Alzheimer's dementia and also provide practical insights into neuro-glial interactions in glutamate toxicity.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics empowers deep profiling of proteome and protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we review the advances and limitations in historic and recent AD proteomic research. Complementary to genetic mapping, proteomic studies not only validate canonical amyloid and tau pathways, but also uncover novel components in broad protein networks, such as RNA splicing, development, immunity, membrane transport, lipid metabolism, synaptic function, and mitochondrial activity. Meta-analysis of seven deep datasets reveals 2,698 differentially expressed (DE) proteins in the landscape of AD brain proteome ( n = 12,017 proteins/genes), covering 35 reported AD genes and risk loci. The DE proteins contain cellular markers enriched in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and epithelial cells, supporting the involvement of diverse cell types in AD pathology. We discuss the hypothesized protective or detrimental roles of selected DE proteins, emphasizing top proteins in “amyloidome” (all biomolecules in amyloid plaques) and disease progression. Comprehensive PTM analysis represents another layer of molecular events in AD. In particular, tau PTMs are correlated with disease stages and indicate the heterogeneity of individual AD patients. Moreover, the unprecedented proteomic coverage of biofluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid and serum, procures novel putative AD biomarkers through meta-analysis. Thus, proteomics-driven systems biology presents a new frontier to link genotype, proteotype, and phenotype, accelerating the development of improved AD models and treatment strategies.},

In this study, we have mapped gray matter density by means of voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted MRI volume sets in 19 patients with mild AD and 16 healthy subjects of similar age and gender ratio and report highly significant clusters of gray matter loss with almost symmetrical distribution, affecting mainly and in decreasing order of significance the medial temporal structures, the posterior cingulate gyrus and adjacent precuneus, and the temporoparietal association and perisylvian neocortex, with only little atrophy in the frontal lobe. The findings are discussed in light of previous studies of gray matter atrophy in AD based either on postmortem or neuroimaging data and in relation to PET studies of resting glucose consumption. The limitations of the method are also discussed in some detail, especially with respect to the segmentation and spatial normalization procedures as they apply to pathological brains. Some potential applications of voxel-based morphometry in the study of AD are also mentioned.},

abstract = {A hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a uniquely human brain disorder rooted in its exceptional process of myelination is presented. Cortical regions with the most protracted development are most vulnerable to AD pathology, and this protracted development is driven by oligodendrocytes, which continue to differentiate into myelin producing cells late into the fifth decade of life. The unique metabolic demands of producing and maintaining their vast myelin sheaths and synthesizing the brain's cholesterol supply make oligodendrocytes especially susceptible to a variety of insults. Their vulnerability increases with increasing age at differentiation as later-differentiating cells myelinate increasing numbers of axonal segments. These vulnerable late-differentiating cells drive the protracted process of intracortical myelination and by increasing local cholesterol and iron levels, progressively increase the toxicity of the intracortical environment forming the basis for the age risk factor for AD. At older ages, the roughly bilaterally symmetrical continuum of oligodendrocyte vulnerability manifests as a progressive pattern of myelin breakdown that recapitulates the developmental process of myelination in reverse. The ensuing homeostatic responses to myelin breakdown further increase intracortical toxicity and results in the relentless progression and non-random anatomical distribution of AD lesions that eventually cause neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. This process causes a slowly progressive disruption of neural impulse transmission that degrades the temporal synchrony of widely distributed neural networks underlying normal brain function. The resulting network "disconnections" first impact functions that are most dependent on large-scale synchronization including higher cognitive functions and formation of new memories. Multiple genetic and environmental risk factors (e.g. amyloid beta-peptide and free radical toxicity, head trauma, anoxia, cholesterol levels, etc.) can contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in aging and AD through their impact on the life-long trajectory of myelin development and breakdown. This development-to-degeneration model is testable through imaging and post mortem methods and highlights the vital role of myelin in impulse transmission and synchronous brain function. The model offers a framework that explains the anatomical distribution and progressive course of AD pathology, some of the failures of promising therapeutic interventions, and suggests further testable hypotheses as well as novel approaches for intervention efforts.},

This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

These include Diffusion Imaging (DI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), isotropically weighted imaging, and q-space imaging. Just as DI provides useful information about molecular displacements in one dimension with which to characterize diffusion in isotropic tissues, DTI provides information about molecular displacements in three dimensions needed to characterize diffusion is anisotropic tissues. DTI also furnishes scalar parameters that behave like quantitative histological or physiologicallsquostainsrsquo for different features of diffusion. These include Trace(D), which is related to the mean diffusivity, and a family of parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which characterize different features of anisotropic diffusion. Simple thought experiments and geometrical constructs, such as the diffusion ellipsoid, can be used to understand water diffusion in isotropic and anisotropic media, and the NMR experiments used to characterize it.},

abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e., that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, , which is estimated in each voxel. First, is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, D and − D , respectively (where D = Trace( )/3 is the mean diffusivity, and is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which is estimated in each voxel from a series of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

abstract = {Despite substantial recent progress, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying complex brain function and cognition remains incomplete. Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching brain structure and function from an explicitly integrative perspective, network neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze and model the elements and interactions of neurobiological systems. Two parallel trends drive the approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.},

abstract = {The two current major staging systems in use for Lewy body disorders fail to classify up to 50% of subjects. Both systems do not allow for large numbers of subjects who have Lewy-type alpha-synucleinopathy (LTS) confined to the olfactory bulb or who pass through a limbic-predominant pathway that at least initially bypasses the brainstem. The results of the current study, based on examination of a standard set of ten brain regions from 417 subjects stained immunohistochemically for alpha-synuclein, suggest a new staging system that, in this study, allows for the classification of all subjects with Lewy body disorders. The autopsied subjects included elderly subjects with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, incidental Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies, as well as comparison groups without Lewy bodies. All subjects were classifiable into one of the following stages: I. Olfactory Bulb Only; IIa Brainstem Predominant; IIb Limbic Predominant; III Brainstem and Limbic; IV Neocortical. Progression of subjects through these stages was accompanied by a generally stepwise worsening in terms of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase concentration, substantia nigra pigmented neuron loss score, Mini Mental State Examination score and score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part 3. Additionally, there were significant correlations between these measures and LTS density scores. It is suggested that the proposed staging system would improve on its predecessors by allowing classification of a much greater proportion of cases.},

abstract = {Objectives: To characterize the nature and extent of basal ganglia involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genotypes in vivo. Methods: Forty-four healthy controls and 39 patients with ALS were included in the study. Thirty patients with ALS had a negative C9orf72 status and 9 patients with ALS carried the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. High-resolution T1-weightedMRI data were used formodel-based subcortical registration and segmentation. Fifteen subcortical structures were studied with both volumetric and vertex-wise approaches. Changes in basal ganglia diffusivity parameters were also assessed. Results: Using age as a covariate, patients with ALS who were C9orf72 repeat negative showed significant volume reductions in the left caudate nucleus (p = 0.01), left hippocampus (p = 0.007), and right accumbens nucleus (p = 0.001) compared with healthy controls. Vertex-wise shape analyses revealed changes affecting the superior and inferior aspects of the bilateral thalami, the lateral and inferior portion of the left hippocampus, and the medial and superior aspect of the left caudate. Basal ganglia pathology was more extensive in patients with ALS carrying the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Conclusions: ALS is associated with widespread basal ganglia involvement. Caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens atrophy are key features of ALS. Dysfunction of frontostriatal networks is likely to contribute to the unique neuropsychological profile of ALS, dominated by executive dysfunction, apathy, and deficits in social cognition. Our quantitative imaging findings are consistent with postmortem studies and indicate that subcortical gray matter structures should be included in future biomarker studies of ALS. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) phenotypes have distinctive and well-established cortical signatures, but their subcortical grey matter profiles are poorly characterised. The comprehensive characterisation of striatal and thalamic pathology along the ALS-FTD spectrum is particularly timely, as dysfunction of frontostriatal and cortico-thalamic networks contribute to phenotype-defining cognitive, behavioral, and motor deficits. Ten patients with behavioral-variant FTD, 11 patients with non-fluent-variant primary progressive aphasia, 5 patients with semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia, 14 ALS-FTD patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansions, 12 ALS-FTD patients without hexanucleotide repeats, 36 ALS patients without cognitive impairment and 50 healthy controls were included in a prospective neuroimaging study. Striatal, thalamic, hippocampal and amygdala pathology was evaluated using volume measurements, density analyses and connectivity-based segmentation. Significant volume reductions were identified in the thalamus and putamen of non-fluent-variant PPA patients. Marked nucleus accumbens and hippocampal atrophy was observed in the behavioral-variant FTD cohort. Semantic-variant PPA patients only exhibited volumetric changes in the left hippocampus. C9-positive ALS-FTD patients showed preferential density reductions in thalamic sub-regions connected to motor and sensory cortical areas. C9-negative ALS-FTD patients exhibited striatal pathology in sub-regions projecting to rostral-motor and executive cortical areas. The bulk of striatal and thalamic pathology in non-fluent-variant PPA patients was identified in foci projecting to motor areas. Subcortical density alterations in svPPA patients were limited to basal ganglia regions with parietal projections. Striatal and thalamic changes in FTD exhibit selective, network-defined vulnerability patterns mirroring cortical pathology. Multi-modal cortico-basal imaging analyses confirm that the subcortical grey matter profiles of FTD phenotypes are just as distinct as their cortical signatures. Our findings support emerging concepts of network-wise degeneration, preferential circuit vulnerability and disease propagation along connectivity patterns.},

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) integrate complex inputs to encode multiple signals that influence motivated behaviors via diverse projections. Here, we combine axon-initiated viral transduction with rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing and Cre-based cell-type-specific targeting to systematically map input-output relationships of VTA-DA neurons. We found that VTA-DA (and VTA-GABA) neurons receive excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory input from diverse sources. VTA-DA neurons projecting to different forebrain regions exhibit specific biases in their input selection. VTA-DA neurons projecting to lateral and medial nucleus accumbens innervate largely non-overlapping striatal targets, with the latter also sending extensive extra-striatal axon collaterals. Using electrophysiology and behavior, we validated new circuits identified in our tracing studies, including a previously unappreciated top-down reinforcing circuit from anterior cortex to lateral nucleus accumbens via VTA-DA neurons. This study highlights the utility of our viral-genetic tracing strategies to elucidate the complex neural substrates that underlie motivated behaviors.},

We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/‘proxy' AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE $\epsilon$4 allele.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Brain alterations in structure and function have been identified in people with risk factors for sporadic type Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that alterations can be detected decades before AD diagnosis. Although the effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 on the brain is well-studied, less is known about the effect of family history of AD. We examined the main effects of family history and APOE varepsilon4 on brain integrity, in addition to assessing possible additive effects of these two risk factors. METHODS Diffusion tensor imaging was performed in 136 middle-aged asymptomatic participants stratified on family history and APOE varepsilon4. Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were entered in factorial analyses to test the effect of AD risk on microstructural brain integrity. We performed a post hoc analysis of the three principal diffusivities (lambda1, lambda2, lambda3) to provide potential additional insight on underlying tissue differences. RESULTS Parental family history of AD was associated with lower FA in regions of the brain known to be affected by AD, including cingulum, corpus callosum, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, hippocampus, and adjacent white matter. Contrary to previous reports, there was no main effect of APOE varepsilon4; however, there was an additive effect of family history and APOE varepsilon4 in which family history-positive participants who were also APOE varepsilon4 carriers had the lowest FA compared with the other groups. CONCLUSIONS The data indicate that unknown risk factors contained in family history are associated with changes in microstructural brain integrity in areas of the brain known to be affected by AD. Importantly, the results provide further evidence that AD pathology might be detected before cognitive changes, perhaps decades before disease onset.},

abstract = {This article describes research criteria and probability methodology for the diagnosis of prodromal PD. Prodromal disease refers to the stage wherein early symptoms or signs of PD neurodegeneration are present, but classic clinical diagnosis based on fully evolved motor parkinsonism is not yet possible. Given the lack of clear neuroprotective/disease-modifying therapy for prodromal PD, these criteria were developed for research purposes only. The criteria are based upon the likelihood of prodromal disease being present with probable prodromal PD defined as ≥80% certainty. Certainty estimates rely upon calculation of an individual's risk of having prodromal PD, using a Bayesian na{\"{i}}ve classifier. In this methodology, a previous probability of prodromal disease is delineated based upon age. Then, the probability of prodromal PD is calculated by adding diagnostic information, expressed as likelihood ratios. This diagnostic information combines estimates of background risk (from environmental risk factors and genetic findings) and results of diagnostic marker testing. In order to be included, diagnostic markers had to have prospective evidence documenting ability to predict clinical PD. They include motor and nonmotor clinical symptoms, clinical signs, and ancillary diagnostic tests. These criteria represent a first step in the formal delineation of early stages of PD and will require constant updating as more information becomes available.},

This information can be used for fiber tracking; however, diffusion MR is susceptible to noise and multiple other sources of uncertainty affecting the measured orientation of fiber bundles. The proposed residual bootstrap method utilizes a spherical harmonic representation for high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data in order to estimate the uncertainty in multimodal q-ball reconstructions. The accuracy of the q-ball residual bootstrap technique was examined through simulation. The residual bootstrap method was then used in combination with q-ball imaging to construct a probabilistic streamline fiber tracking algorithm. The residual bootstrap q-ball fiber tracking algorithm is capable of following the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum through regions of crossing white matter tracts in the centrum semiovale. This fiber tracking algorithm is an improvement upon prior diffusion tensor methods and the q-ball data can be acquired in a clinically feasible time frame.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaque deposition in specific brain regions is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism underlying the regional vulnerability to A$\beta$ deposition in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that endogenous neuronal activity regulates the regional concentration of interstitial fluid (ISF) A$\beta$, which drives local A$\beta$ aggregation. Using in vivo microdialysis, we show that ISF A$\beta$ concentrations in several brain regions of APP transgenic mice before plaque deposition were commensurate with the degree of subsequent plaque deposition and with the concentration of lactate, a marker of neuronal activity. Furthermore, unilateral vibrissal stimulation increased ISF A$\beta$, and unilateral vibrissal deprivation decreased ISF A$\beta$ and lactate, in contralateral barrel cortex. Long-term unilateral vibrissal deprivation decreased amyloid plaque formation and growth. Our results suggest a mechanism to account for the vulnerability of specific brain regions to A$\beta$ deposition in Alzheimer's disease.},

The novelty of our approach consists in the representation of the brain as two superposed graphs where toxic proteins diffuse, the connectivity graph which represents the neural network, and the proximity graph which takes into account the extracellular space. Toxic proteins such as $$\beta $$ $\beta$ amyloid and Tau play in fact a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and, separately, have been targets of medical treatments.

This paper describes the history of Version 3 development and the UDS data that are freely available to researchers. METHODS UDS Version 3 was developed after years of coordination between the National Institute on Aging-appointed Clinical Task Force (CTF), clinicians from ∼30 ADCs, and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). The CTF recognized the need for updates to align with the state of the science in dementia research, while being flexible to the diverse needs and diseases studied at the ADCs. Version 3 also developed a nonproprietary neuropsychological battery. RESULTS This paper focuses on the substantial Version 3 changes to the UDS forms related to clinical diagnosis and characterization of clinical symptoms to match updated consensus-based diagnostic criteria. Between March 2015 and March 2018, 4820 participants were enrolled using UDS Version 3. Longitudinal data were available for 25,337 of the 37,568 total participants using all UDS versions. DISCUSSION The results from utilization of the UDS highlight the possibility for numerous research institutions to successfully collaborate, produce, and use standardized data collection instruments for over a decade.},

abstract = {Background: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, neuronal polarity and synaptic connectivity are compromised. A key structure for regulating polarity and functions of neurons is the axon initial segment (AIS), which segregates somatodendritic from axonal proteins and initiates action potentials. Toxic tau species, including extracellular oligomers (xcTauOs), spread tau pathology from neuron to neuron by a prion-like process, but few other cell biological effects of xcTauOs have been described. Objective: Test the hypothesis that AIS structure is sensitive to xcTauOs. Methods: Cultured wild type (WT) and tau knockout (KO) mouse cortical neurons were exposed to xcTauOs, and quantitative western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-TRIM46 monitored effects on the AIS. The same methods were used to compare TRIM46 and two other resident AIS proteins in human hippocampal tissue obtained from AD and age-matched non-AD donors. Results: Without affecting total TRIM46 levels, xcTauOs reduce the concentration of TRIM46 within the AIS and cause AIS shortening in cultured WT, but not TKO neurons. Lentiviral-driven tau expression in tau KO neurons rescues AIS length sensitivity to xcTauOs. In human AD hippocampus, the overall protein levels of multiple resident AIS proteins are unchanged compared to non-AD brain, but TRIM46 concentration within the AIS and AIS length are reduced in neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles. Conclusion: xcTauOs cause partial AIS damage in cultured neurons by a mechanism dependent on intracellular tau, thereby raising the possibility that the observed AIS reduction in AD neurons in vivo is caused by xcTauOs working in concert with endogenous neuronal tau.},

METHODS We characterized the temporal trajectories of measures of verbal episodic memory, short-term visual memory, and mental status using data from 895 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. RESULTS The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) immediate recall was the first measure to decline, followed by CVLT delayed recall. However, further along the disease progression scale, CVLT delayed recall and visual memory changed more rapidly than CVLT immediate recall. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reconcile reports of early changes in immediate recall with greater reliance on delayed recall performance in clinical settings. Moreover, the utility of cognitive markers in evaluating AD progression depends on the stage of cognitive decline, suggesting that optimal endpoints in therapeutic trials may vary across different stages of the disease process.},

abstract = {Progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction are the hallmark clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying the molecular triggers for the onset of AD-related cognitive decline presently requires the use of suitable animal models, such as the 3xTg-AD mice, which develop both amyloid and tangle pathology. Here, we characterize the onset of learning and memory deficits in this model. We report that 2-month-old, prepathologic mice are cognitively unimpaired. The earliest cognitive impairment manifests at 4 months as a deficit in long-term retention and correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta in the hippocampus and amygdala. Plaque or tangle pathology is not apparent at this age, suggesting that they contribute to cognitive dysfunction at later time points. Clearance of the intraneuronal Abeta pathology by immunotherapy rescues the early cognitive deficits on a hippocampal-dependent task. Reemergence of the Abeta pathology again leads to cognitive deficits. This study strongly implicates intraneuronal Abeta in the onset of cognitive dysfunction.},

Pattern recognition receptors expressed on the microglial surface seem to be one of the primary, common pathways by which diverse toxin signals are transduced into ROS production. Overactivated microglia can be detected using imaging techniques and therefore this knowledge offers an opportunity not only for early diagnosis but, importantly, for the development of targeted anti-inflammatory therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare patterns of brain atrophy in fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) since atrophy in individual areas may not be sufficiently specific as diagnostic marker. Methods: Frontal, temporal and hippocampal atrophy was measured from MRI of 10 FTD patients, 27 AD, and 27 controls. Corrected atrophy and asymmetry were computed (W-scores). Results: FTD had mild atrophy in the hippocampus (average W-score=−1.3), severe in the frontal (W-score=−2.4) and very severe in the temporal lobes (W-score=−2.9). AD had moderate atrophy in the hippocampus and temporal lobes (W-score=−1.8 and −1.9, respectively), and very mild frontal atrophy (W-score=−0.9). Atrophy was more asymmetrical in FTD (left more atrophic) than in AD patients, particularly in the temporal lobes. A discriminant function including the asymmetry values of frontal and temporal regions could separate FTD from AD with 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Conclusions: FTD is characterized by a specific pattern of atrophy, more useful than atrophy of single regions in the differential diagnosis.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

Computational analysis of these patterns is made possible by genome-scale mapping of the C57BL/6J mouse brain in the Allen Brain Atlas. Here we describe methodology used to explore the spatial structure of gene expression patterns across a set of 3041 genes chosen on the basis of consistency across experimental observations (N=2). The analysis was performed on smoothed, co-registered 3D expression volumes for each gene obtained by aggregating cellular resolution image data. Following dimensionality and noise reduction, voxels were clustered according to similarity of expression across the gene set. We illustrate the resulting parcellations of the mouse brain for different numbers of clusters (K) and quantitatively compare these parcellations with a classically-defined anatomical reference atlas at different levels of granularity, revealing a high degree of correspondence. These observations suggest that spatial localization of gene expression offers substantial promise in connecting knowledge at the molecular level with higher-level information about brain organization.},

abstract = {In process modelling, knowledge of the process under consideration is typically partial with significant unknown inputs (disturbances) to the model. Disturbances militate against the desirable trait of model reproducibility. "Grey-box" identification can assist, in these circumstances, by taking advantage of the two sources of information that may be available: any invariant prior knowledge and response data from experiments. Practical Grey-box Process Identification is a three-stranded response to the following questions which are frequently raised in connection with grey-box methods: How much of my prior knowledge is useful and even correct in this environment? Are my experimental data sufficient and relevant? What do I do about the disturbances that I can't get rid of? How do I know when my model is good enough?The first part of the book is a short review of the theoretical fundamentals of grey-box identification, focussing particularly on the theory necessary for the software presented in the second part. Part II puts the spotlight on MoCaVa, a MATLAB{\textregistered}-compatible software tool, downloadable from springeronline.com, for facilitating the procedure of effective grey-box identification. Part III demonstrates the application of MoCaVa using two case studies drawn from the paper and steel industries. More advanced theory is laid out in an appendix and the MoCaVa source code enables readers to expand on its capabilities to their own ends. Practical Grey-box Process Identification will be of great interest and help to process control engineers and researchers and the software show-cased here will be of much practical assistance to students doing project work in this field.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease presents morphologically with senile plaques, primarily made of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits, and neurofibrillary lesions, which consist of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. To study the in vivo induction of tau pathology, dilute brain extracts from aged A beta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice were intracerebrally infused in young B6/P301L tau transgenic mice. Six months after the infusion, tau pathology was induced in the injected hippocampus but also in brain regions well beyond the injection sites such as the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, areas with neuronal projection to the injection site. No or only modest tau induction was observed when brain extracts from aged nontransgenic control mice and aged tau-depositing B6/P301L transgenic mice were infused. To further study A beta-induced tau lesions B6/P301L tau transgenic mice were crossed with APP23 mice. Although A beta deposition in double-transgenic mice did not differ from single APP23 transgenic mice, double-transgenic mice revealed increased tau pathology compared to single B6/P301L tau transgenic mice predominately in areas with high A beta plaque load. The present results suggest that both extract-derived A beta species and deposited fibrillary A beta can induce the formation of tau neurofibrillary pathology. The observation that infused A beta can trigger the tau pathology in the absence of A beta deposits provides an explanation for the discrepancy between the neuroanatomical location of A beta deposits and the development and spreading of tau lesions in Alzheimer's disease brain.},

abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. Excess tau can be released into the extracellular medium in a physiological or pathological manner to be internalized by surrounding neurons-a process that contributes to the spread of this protein throughout the brain. Such spreading may correlate with the progression of the abovementioned diseases. In addition to neurons, tau can be internalized into other cells. Here we demonstrate that microglia take up tau in vitro and in vivo. In this regard, microglia from primary cultures internalized soluble (human recombinant tau42) and insoluble (homogenates derived from human AD brain) tau in vitro. Furthermore, using stereotaxic injection of tau in mice in vivo, we show that murine microglia internalize human tau. In addition, we demonstrate, for the first time, that microglia colocalize with various forms of tau in postmortem brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented control subjects. Our data reveal a potential role of microglia in the internalization of tau that might be relevant for the design of strategies to enhance the clearance of extracellular tau in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of this protein.},

abstract = {Filamentous tau pathologies are hallmark lesions of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) which show cell type-specific and topographically distinct tau inclusions. Growing evidence supports templated transmission of tauopathies through functionally interconnected neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that different self-propagating strains of pathological tau could account for the diverse manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Here, we describe the rapid and distinct cell type-specific spread of pathological tau following intracerebral injections of CBD or AD brain extracts enriched in pathological tau (designated CBD-Tau and AD-Tau, respectively) in young human mutant P301S tau transgenic (Tg) mice (line PS19) $\sim$6–9 months before they show onset of mutant tau transgene-induced tau pathology. At 1 month post-injection of CBD-Tau, tau inclusions developed predominantly in oligodendrocytes of the fimbria and white matter near the injection sites with infrequent intraneuronal tau aggregates. In contrast, injections of AD-Tau in young PS19 mice induced tau pathology predominantly in neuronal perikarya with little or no oligodendrocyte involvement 1 month post-injection. With longer post-injection survival intervals of up to 6 months, CBD-Tau- and AD-Tau-induced tau pathology spread to different brain regions distant from the injection sites while maintaining the cell type-specific pattern noted above. Finally, CA3 neuron loss was detected 3 months post-injection of AD-Tau but not CBD-Tau. Thus, AD-Tau and CBD-Tau represent specific pathological tau strains that spread differentially and may underlie distinct clinical and pathological features of these two tauopathies. Hence, these strains could become targets to develop disease-modifying therapies for CBD and AD.},

OBJECTIVE To analyze white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) tissue organization in patients with fvFTD and tvFTD by means of diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry, and the correlations with neuropsychological and behavioral variables. DESIGN AND SETTING Frontotemporal dementia clinic-based cohort and structural magnetic resonance imaging acquisition for voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging measurements. Abnormalities were detected by a comparison with healthy control subjects. These variables were also correlated with clinical scores. Patients Thirty-six patients (28 with fvFTD and 8 with tvFTD) in early disease stage and 23 healthy controls who underwent standardized clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging. INTERVENTIONS Diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neuroimaging analyses resulted in localized GM atrophy and reductions of white matter densities; the latter correlated with behavioral scores. RESULTS Voxel-based morphometry analysis showed separate patterns of GM atrophy in the 2 groups. Diffusion tensor imaging showed different WM reduction patterns in patients with fvFTD and tvFTD. The fvFTD group showed a selective WM reduction in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, interconnecting the frontal and occipital and the temporal and parietal regions. Conversely, patients with tvFTD were characterized by WM reductions in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, which affected the connections between anterior temporal and frontal regions. The WM reductions in fvFTD paralleled both behavioral disturbances measured by Frontal Behavioral Inventory and neuropsychological deficits affecting frontal functions. CONCLUSIONS The fvFTD and tvFTD variants are associated not only with selective local GM reductions but also with significant WM damage in early disease phase. The different WM patterns contribute to the different clinical syndromes in FTD and could be responsible for the further progression of atrophy in the later disease stages.},

Indeed, a clinical diagnosis of resting tremor, rigidity, movement and postural deficiencies usually reflect >50% loss of the nigrostriatal system in disease. In a step to address this, quantitative diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) was used to assess nigrostriatal degeneration in the 1-methyl-4- phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication model of dopaminergic nigral degeneration. We now demonstrate increased average diffusion (p < 0.005) and decreased fractional anisotropy (p < 0.03) in the substantia nigra (SN) of 5- to 7-day MPTP-treated animals when compared to saline controls. Transverse diffusivity demonstrated the most significant differences (p ≤0.002) and correlated with the numbers of SN dopaminergic neurons (r = −0.75, p = 0.012). No differences were found in the striatum, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, or ventricles. These results demonstrate that DTI may be used as a surrogate biomarker of nigral dopaminergic neuronal degeneration.},

METHODS: Ninety-two elderly healthy controls, 32 subjects with aMCI, and 35 patients with AD were imaged using 11C-PIB PET and MRI. Hippocampal volume was measured and PIB standardized uptake value ratio was extracted after partial volume correction within 41 regions of interest. Global, regional, and voxel-based correlations between PIB and hippocampal volume were computed for each group. RESULTS: In healthy control participants with elevated neocortex PIB retention, significant correlation was found between PIB retention in the inferior temporal region and hippocampal volume using both region-based and voxel-based approaches. No correlation was found in any other group. CONCLUSIONS: The strong correlation between hippocampal atrophy and beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in the Pittsburgh compound B-positive healthy control group suggests that Abeta deposition in the inferior temporal neocortex is related to hippocampal synaptic and neuronal degeneration.},

Examples are drawnfrom a wide range of applications. The book is intended for those who seek an introduction to the area, with an emphasis on applications rather than on detailed theory. It is therefore expected that the book will benefit those attending courses at an advanced undergraduate, or postgraduate, level,as well as researchers, both from statistics and from other disciplines, who wish to learn about and apply these techniques in practical data analysis. The text makes extensive reference to S-Plus, as a computing environment in which examples can be explored. S-Plus functions and example scriptsare provided to implement many of the techniques described. These parts are, however, clearly separate from the main body of text, and can therefore easily be skipped by readers not interested in S-Plus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Progressive brain atrophy is associated with the corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Regional differences in brain atrophy may reflect the clinical features of disease. OBJECTIVE To quantify the structural neuroanatomical differences between CBDS and PSP. DESIGN A survey of neurologic deficits was conducted in all patients. Voxel-based morphometry was used to quantify structural neuroanatomical differences on magnetic resonance images in each subject group. SETTING University hospital dementia clinic. PARTICIPANTS Fourteen patients who met clinical research criteria for CBD and 15 patients who met clinical research criteria for PSP, who were matched for severity of disease, age, and functional status, and 80 age-matched control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Statistically significant differences in regional gray and white matter volume, after multiple comparisons correction, between groups of subjects. RESULTS The patients with CBDS displayed an asymmetric (left > right) pattern of brain atrophy that involved the bilateral premotor cortex, superior parietal lobules, and striatum. Progressive supranuclear palsy was associated with atrophy of the midbrain, pons, thalamus, and striatum, with minimal involvement of the frontal cortex. Midbrain structures were more atrophied in PSP than in CBD, whereas dorsal frontal and parietal cortices were more atrophied in CBD than in PSP. The degree of atrophy of the midbrain and pontine tegmentum and the left frontal eye field differentiated the 2 patient groups with 93% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Distinct patterns of brain atrophy exist in CBDS and PSP that can be used to differentiate the 2 diseases. Assessments of brain atrophy in these disorders should be focused on cortical and brainstem ocular motor control areas.},

abstract = {What was once called Pick's disease has three major anatomic variants. With all three, frontotemporal brain is selectively injured whereas posterior cortical regions are spared. These three clinical patterns include a bifrontal, slightly asymmetric subtype with more involvement of the right frontotemporal region called frontotemporal dementia or the frontal variant of FTD (fvFTD), a temporal-predominant subtype called the temporal variant of FTD or semantic dementia (SD), and a left frontal-predominant subtype called progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). The three anatomic groups help to classify distinctive clinical syndromes with unique features. Careful study of these subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, using combinations of new quantitative neuroimaging, behavioral and physiological measures are yielding important information about the functioning of the brain's frontal and temporal regions. As we come to better understand the biologic basis for the three FTD clinical syndromes, new classification schemas may emerge, but our current clinical criteria serve as a strong guide to the diagnosis and separation of FTD from Alzheimer disease and other dementias.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the extent and the nature of white matter tissue damage of patients with Alzheimer's disease using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI). Background: Although Alzheimer's disease pathology mainly affects cortical grey matter, previous pathological and MRI studies showed that also the brain white matter of patients is damaged. However, the nature of Alzheimer's disease associated white matter damage is still unclear. Methods: Conventional and DT-MRI scans were obtained from16 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 10 sex and age matched healthy volunteers. The mean diffusivity ([IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0">), fractional anisotropy (FA), and inter-voxel coherence (C) of several white matter regions were measured. Results: [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"> was higher and FA lower in the corpus callosum, as well as in the white matter of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in the corresponding regions from healthy controls. [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"> and FA of the white matter of the occipital lobe and internal capsule were not different between patients and controls. C values were also not different between patients and controls for any of the regions studied.

Conclusions: White matter changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease are likely to be secondary to wallerian degeneration of fibre tracts due to neuronal loss in cortical associative areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether different patterns of regional gray matter loss in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with different risks of conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD), using MRI and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). METHODS: The authors recruited 22 patients with MCI, 22 patients with probable AD, and 20 healthy subjects (HS). T1 volumes from each subject were postprocessed according to an optimized VBM protocol. All patients were clinically followed up (mean [SD] time = 28.7 [5.7] months), and patients with MCI were reclassified into two groups (converters and nonconverters to AD). RESULTS: When comparing patients with AD to HS, widespread areas of reduced gray matter density were found predominantly in temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes and in the insula. Comparing MCI converters and nonconverters with HS, the converters showed more widespread areas of reduced gray matter density than nonconverters, with a pattern of abnormalities similar to that seen in patients with AD. Conversely, when comparing the same groups with patients with AD, MCI nonconverters showed a pattern of gray matter density similar to that of HS. Areas of decreased gray matter density were also found in MCI converters compared with nonconverters. CONCLUSIONS: Different patterns of gray matter density distribution in patients with mild cognitive impairment may be associated to different rates of conversion to Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clearer that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with regional grey matter (GM) damage, but also with abnormal integration between cortical brain regions by disconnection mechanism. This concept comes from the evidence that white matter (WM) damage (as assessed by diffusion MR imaging) can be observed in patients with AD since the early clinical stages, and it correlates with clinical measures of cognitive disability. In this perspective, several functional imaging studies, based on PET and resting state fMRI, have provided evidence that brain hypometabolism/disconnection may precede the occurrence of GM atrophy in certain regions of AD brains, such as the cingulate cortex. The cingulum represents the most prominent WM tract of the limbic system, being directly connected to the medial temporal lobe structures. Therefore, this structure likely contributes to changes in functional connectivity observed within the so called default-mode network of AD patients, and its damage is likely to play a remarkable role in the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Nowadays, the combination of several neuroimaging techniques that provide both, measures of regional GM loss and measures of functional and structural connectivity offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the pathophysiological changes of brain tissue modifications across the clinical evolution of AD. This paper reviews the main MR based methods of investigation of brain tissue involvement in patients with AD and MCI, and the role they have played in clarifying the differential contribution of GM damage and brain disconnection to AD pathophysiology. This subject seems to be relevant for both, speculative aspects of neurology and application to clinical trials.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggest that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with regional gray matter damage but also with abnormal functional integration of different brain regions by disconnection mechanisms. A measure of anatomical connectivity (anatomical connectivity mapping or ACM) can be obtained by initiating diffusion tractography streamlines from all parenchymal voxels and then counting the number of streamlines passing through each voxel of the brain. In order to assess the potential of this parameter for the study of disconnection in AD, we computed it in a group of patients with AD (N=9), in 16 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI, which is considered the prodromal stage of AD) and in 12 healthy volunteers. All subjects had an MRI scan at 3T, and diffusion MRI data were analyzed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) and ACM. Two types of ACM maps, absolute count (ac-ACM) and normalized by brain size count (nc-ACM), were obtained. No between group differences in FA surviving correction for multiple comparison were found, while areas of both decreased (in the supramarginal gyrus) and increased (in the putamen) ACM were found in patients with AD. Similar results were obtained with ac-ACM and nc-ACM. ACM of the supramarginal gyrus was strongly associated with measures of short-term memory in healthy subjects. This study shows that ACM provides information that is complementary to that offered by FA and appears to be more sensitive than FA to brain changes in patients with AD. The increased ACM in the putamen was unexpected. Given the nature of ACM, an increase of this parameter may reflect a change in any of the areas connected to it. One intriguing possibility is that this increase of ACM in AD patients might reflect processes of brain plasticity driven by cholinesterase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder in which predisposed neuronal types in specific regions of the human peripheral, enteric, and central nervous systems become progressively involved. A staging procedure for the PD-related inclusion body pathology (i.e., Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) in the brain proposes that the pathological process begins at two sites and progresses in a topographically predictable sequence in 6 stages. During stages 1-2, the inclusion body pathology remains confined to the medulla oblongata, pontine tegmentum, and anterior olfactory structures. In stages 3-4, the basal mid- and forebrain become the focus of the pathology and the illness reaches its symptomatic phase. In the final stages 5-6, the pathological process is seen in the association areas and primary fields of the neocortex. To date, we have staged a total of 301 autopsy cases, including 106 cases with incidental pathology and 176 clinically diagnosed PD cases. In addition, 163 age-matched controls were examined. 19 of the 301 cases with PD-related pathology displayed a pathological distribution pattern of Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies that diverged from the staging scheme described above. In these cases, olfactory structures and the amygdala were predominantly involved in the virtual absence of brain stem pathology. Most of the divergent cases (17/19) had advanced concomitant Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary changes (stages IV-VI).},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease entails multiple neuronal systems and results from neuronal cytoskeletal degeneration of only a few types of nerve cells. Essential for neuropathological diagnosis is assessment of the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The destructive process begins in predisposed cortical induction sites, thereafter invading other portions of the cerebral cortex and specific sets of subcortical nuclei in a predictable sequence with little variation. The location of the tangle-bearing neurons and severity of the pathology allow the distinction of six stages in disease propagation (transentorhinal I-II: clinically silent cases; limbic III-IV: incipient Alzheimer's disease; neocortical V-VI: fully-developed Alzheimer's disease). The pattern of appearance of the neurofibrillary changes bears a striking resemblance to the inverse sequence of cortical myelination. The average myelin content is a negative image of the density of intraneuronal lipofuscin deposits. Pigment-laden neurons endowed with a long, thin, and sparsely myelinated axon are prone to develop AD-related changes. The emergence of the first neurofibrillary changes, at whatever age these occur, signals the onset of a degenerative process that persists until death. An extended period of time elapses between the beginning of histologically verifiable lesions and the appearance of initial clinical symptoms. Once initiated, however, cytoskeletal deterioration inexorably progresses, and neither remission nor recovery is observed.},

The most conspicuous changes seen in the brain are deposits of insoluble proteins in both extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The extracellular deposits consist primarily of a specific A4 amyloid protein. The significance of these deposits remains to be determined, as they are often found in the cerebral cortex of non-demented elderly persons. More telling is the gradual accumulation of insoluble fibrous material within some neurons that consists mainly of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. Six stages of increasingly severe cortical destruction can be distinguished. Stages I and II are characterized by neurofibrillary changes that are largely confined to the transentorhinal region, whereas stages III and IV are marked by severe involvement of both the entorhinal and transentorhinal regions. Isocortical destruction occurs during stages V and VI. This progression in cortical pathology correlates with the gradual worsening of clinical symptoms.},

The distribution pattern and packing density of amyloid deposits turned out to be of limited significance for differentiation of neuropathological stages. Neurofibrillary changes occurred in the form of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-alpha (transentorhinal stages I-II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III-IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-alpha in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V-VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations.},

abstract = {The pathological process underlying sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) that is associated with the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions of a nuclear protein (TDP-43) is confined to only a few types of long-axoned projection neurons. The giant Betz pyramidal cells of the primary motor neocortex as well as large $\alpha$-motor neurons of the lower brainstem and spinal cord become involved early. In the human brain, these 2 neuronal types are to a large extent interconnected by monosynaptic axonal projections. The cell nuclei of affected neurons gradually forfeit their normal expression of the protein TDP-43. In $\alpha$-motor neurons, this nuclear loss is followed by the formation of insoluble TDP-43-immunopositive inclusions in the cytoplasm, whereas in Betz cells the loss of nuclear expression remains for an unknown period of time unaccompanied by somatodendritic and/or axoplasmic aggregations. It is possible that in cortical pyramidal cells (Betz cells) the nuclear clearing initially leads to the formation of an abnormal but still soluble cytoplasmic TDP-43 which may enter the axoplasm and, following transmission via direct synaptic contacts, induces anew TDP-43 dysregulation and aggregation in recipient neurons. The trajectory of the spreading pattern that consecutively develops during the course of sALS is consistent with the dissemination from chiefly cortical projection neurons via axonal transport through direct synaptic contacts leading to the secondary induction of TDP-43-containing inclusions within recipient nerve cells in involved subcortical regions.},

abstract = {The entorhinal territory consists of the entorhinal and transentorhinal regions spreading over the ambient gyrus and anterior portions of the parahippocampal gyrus. The transentorhinal region mediates between the adjoining temporal isocortex laterally and the entorhinal region medially. The entorhinal cortex consists of a molecular layer, followed by an external principal stratum, a cell-sparse lamina dissecans, an internal principal stratum and--within the underlying white matter--a profound cellular layer. The principal strata can each be divided into three layers Pre alpha, beta, gamma, and Pri alpha, beta, gamma. Data obtained from experimental investigations in monkeys reveal that the entorhinal territory serves as a relay station for information from both isocortical association areas and centers of the limbic system. After processing within the entorhinal cortex, this information is transferred to the hippocampal formation via the perforant path. Pathological changes within the entorhinal territory impair this continuous data transfer and contribute to a decline of cognitive functions. Entorhinal involvement associated with impaired cognitive functions is described in cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with argyrophilic grains and Huntington's disease.},

abstract = {The proteinopathy sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) is the second most frequent degenerative disorder of the human nervous system after Alzheimer's disease. The alpha-synuclein inclusion body pathology (Lewy pathology) associated with sPD is distributed throughout the central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems. The resulting nonrandom neuronal dysfunction and, in some regions, neuronal loss is reflected in a topographic distribution pattern of the Lewy pathology that, in the brain, can be staged. Except for olfactory structures and spinal cord constituents of the pain system, sensory components of the nervous system remain uninvolved or virtually intact. The most disease-related damage revolves around motor areas--particularly around superordinate centers of the limbic and visceromotor systems as well as portions of the somatomotor system. Vulnerable regions are interconnected anatomically and susceptible nerve cell types are not neurotransmitter-dependent. Not all clinical symptoms emerging in the course of sPD can be explained by a lack of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system. These include autonomic dysfunction, pain, hyposmia or anosmia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavioral disorder, depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia. Against the background of the normal morphology and anatomy, the authors analyze the pathoanatomy of sPD in the nervous system at various neuropathological stages and summarize the potential functional consequences of the lesions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW Intraneuronal lesions consisting of abnormal tau protein are seen to develop from the beginning until the end-phase of the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease. This review highlights the earliest phase of this process. RECENT FINDINGS Development of abnormal tau frequently begins during childhood or puberty in nuclei of the lower brainstem sending diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex. Nonfibrillar abnormal tau material first occurs in the proximal axon of projection neurons in the locus coeruleus. Subsequently, a similar material (pretangle material) fills the somatodendritic compartment. In contrast with the pretangle material in cell bodies and dendrites, the nonfibrillar material in the axon normally does not convert into stable fibrillary inclusions. SUMMARY Projection neurons (not only those of the locus coeruleus) are sturdy and can survive for a lifetime despite the existence of Alzheimer-related abnormal tau. Currently, little understood mechanisms most probably exist that enable neurons to fulfill their general functions even when severe tau pathology is present. The proclivity of predisposed neuronal types to develop abnormal tau may be intrinsic to the human brain. However, the tempo of disease progression reveals considerable individual differences, thereby offering opportunities to study conditions that may modify disease progression.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease before severe neuronal dysfunction occurs, but it is still not known when or where in the central nervous system the underlying pathological process begins. In this review, we discuss the idea of possible disease progression from the locus coeruleus to the transentorhinal region of the cerebral cortex via neuron-to-neuron transmission and transsynaptic transport of tau protein aggregates, and we speculate that such a mechanism together with the very long prodromal period that characterizes Alzheimer's disease may be indicative of a prion-like pathogenesis for this tauopathy. The fact that AT8-immunoreactive abnormal tau aggregates (pretangles) develop within proximal axons of noradrenergic coeruleus projection neurons in the absence of both tau lesions (pretangles, NFTs/NTs) in the transentorhinal region as well as cortical amyloid-$\beta$ pathology means that currently used neuropathological stages for Alzheimer's disease will have to be reclassified.},

abstract = {Sporadic Parkinson's disease involves multiple neuronal systems and results from changes developing in a few susceptible types of nerve cells. Essential for neuropathological diagnosis are alpha-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies. The pathological process targets specific induction sites: lesions initially occur in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus. Thereafter, less vulnerable nuclear grays and cortical areas gradually become affected. The disease process in the brain stem pursues an ascending course with little interindividual variation. The pathology in the anterior olfactory nucleus makes fewer incursions into related areas than that developing in the brain stem. Cortical involvement ensues, beginning with the anteromedial temporal mesocortex. From there, the neocortex succumbs, commencing with high order sensory association and prefrontal areas. First order sensory association/premotor areas and primary sensory/motor fields then follow suit. This study traces the course of the pathology in incidental and symptomatic Parkinson cases proposing a staging procedure based upon the readily recognizable topographical extent of the lesions.},

abstract = {From a morphological perspective, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily a degenerative disorder of the neuronal cytoskeleton involving lipofuscin-laden cortical projection neurons with long, thin, and sparsely myelinated axons. The neocortical primary fields, relatively small in extent but functionally sophisticated, exhibit an early and brief myelination cycle, whereas the much more expansive but relatively simply organized association areas undergo a late and prolonged myelination process. The greater the degree of myelination and the less intense the pigmentation, the more resistant a given projection neuron may be to oxidative stress as well as to the development of AD-related neurofibrillary changes and vice versa. The neurofibrillary pathology commences from those cortical areas that are less completely myelinated and gradually progresses to the most functionally developed cortical fields that display the highest degree of myelination, thereby reflecting a hierarchy in the susceptibility of diverse cortical areas to the evolution of the AD-associated cytoskeletal pathology.},

abstract = {Two thousand three hundred and thirty two nonselected brains from 1- to 100-year-old individuals were examined using immunocytochemistry (AT8) and Gallyas silver staining for abnormal tau; immunocytochemistry (4G8) and Campbell-Switzer staining were used for the detection of$\beta$-amyloid. A total of 342 cases was negative in the Gallyas stain but when restaged for AT8 only 10 were immunonegative. Fifty-eight cases had subcortical tau predominantly in the locus coeruleus, but there was no abnormal cortical tau (subcortical Stages a-c). Cortical involvement (abnormal tau in neurites) was identified first in the transentorhinal region (Stage 1a, 38 cases). Transentorhinal pyramidal cells displayed pretangle material (Stage 1b, 236 cases). Pretangles gradually became argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that progressed in parallel with NFT Stages I to VI. Pretangles restricted to subcortical sites were seen chiefly at younger ages. Of the total cases, 1,031 (44.2%) had $\beta$-amyloid plaques. The first plaques occurred in the neocortex after the onset of tauopathy in the brainstem. Plaques generally developed in the 40s in 4% of all cases, culminating in their tenth decade (75%). $\beta$-amyloid plaques and NFTs were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that tauopathy associated with sporadic Alzheimer disease may begin earlier than previously thought and possibly in the lower brainstem rather than in the transentorhinal region.},

Due to this complex differentiation program, and due to their unique metabolism/physiology, oligodendrocytes count among the most vulnerable cells of the CNS. In this review, we first describe the different steps eventually culminating in the formation of mature oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths, as they were revealed by studies in rodents. We will then show differences and similarities of human oligodendrocyte development. Finally, we will lay out the different pathways leading to oligodendrocyte and myelin loss in human CNS diseases, and we will reveal the different principles leading to the restoration of myelin sheaths or to a failure to do so.},

Attempts to comprehensively synthesize resting-state functional connectivity results have focused on the potential utility of functional connectivity as a biomarker for disease risk, disease staging, or prognosis. While these are all appropriate uses of this technique, the purpose of this review is to examine how functional connectivity disruptions inform our understanding of AD pathophysiology. Here, we examine the rationale and methodological considerations behind functional connectivity studies and then provide a critical review of the existing literature. In conclusion, we propose a hypothesis regarding the development and spread of functional connectivity deficits seen in AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To devise a staging scheme for addressing the severity of atrophy in patients with pathologically proven frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and determine any relationship with clinical indices. METHODS Twenty-four cases with clinical and pathologic features of FTD were selected using standard inclusion and exclusion criteria from 125 dementia cases collected in Sydney, Australia, over an 8.5-year period. Patterns of gross atrophy were determined in two coronal brain slices. Reproducibility of a four-stage severity scheme was tested. Nonparametric statistics were used to determine relationships between the stage of atrophy and clinical indices (age at death, duration from diagnosis, and clinical severity at death). RESULTS The FTD cases studied could be reliably grouped (kappa = 0.97) into four progressively severe stages of global atrophy. Initial mild atrophy occurred in the orbital and superior medial frontal cortices and hippocampus (stage 1), progressed to involve the other anterior frontal regions, temporal cortices, and basal ganglia (stage 2), then involved all remaining tissue in these coronal slices (stage 3), until very marked atrophy was observed in all areas (stage 4). These stages correlated with disease duration and clinical dementia severity, lending validity to the progressive nature of the staging scheme. CONCLUSIONS The authors have identified a reproducible staging system for the severity of gross atrophy in cases of FTD. This staging scheme provides the required framework to compare different research indices and determine correlates relating to time and disease progression in FTD-information necessary to determine core disease processes and etiologic factors.},

PET and SPECT can detect changes in striatal dopamine levels after levodopa administration and relate these to motor responses. Loss of cortical dopaminergic and cholinergic function is present in demented PD and, on occasion, amyloid deposits can be detected. Loss of cardiac sympathetic innervation can be sensitively detected in PD with (18)F-dopamine PET or (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine SPECT. Finally, PET can detect widespread brain inflammation in PD.

The aim of the article is to correlate grey and white matter changes and their topography to the results of modern methods for brain imaging such as CT, rCBF, PET, SPECT and NMR in Alzheimer's type of dementia. 2. 2. The findings are based on the study of a large material investigated thoroughly patho-anatomically. The findings are correlated with psychiatric and neurophysiologic follow-up studies. 3. 3. The degenerative grey matter process shows a regionally varying accent according to a pattern which is consistent and typical for the disease. This corresponds to metabolic changes on rCBF, PET and SPECT and thereby becomes of diagnostic value. 4. 4. This pattern is largely symmetric. Metabolic asymmetries have however been reported on PET scans. In this context individual variations of the topographic degenerative brain pattern and normal anatomical brain asymmetries are of interest. 5. 5. The white matter however also frequently shows changes, in particular loss of myelin and axons and a mild gliosis, slight in of the cases and severe in an additional . These changes cause a decrease of density in the centrum semiovale correlating to lipid depletion. They may also influence the ventricular shape and size, of interest in CT or NMR studies. Also here variations in ventricular shape, normal and such due to pathological processes unrelated to the Alzhemier disease, may cause confusion, regarding degree of atrophy and even type of brain process. Such factors should be considered in the interpretation of non-invasive brain studies.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Neurons in the developing brain undergo extensive structural refinement as nascent circuits adopt their mature form 1 . This transformation is facilitated by the engulfment and degradation of excess axonal branches and inappropriate synapses by surrounding glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes 2,3 . However, the small size of phagocytic organelles and the complex, highly ramified morphology of glia has made it difficult to determine the contribution of these and other glial cell types to this process. Here, we used large scale, serial electron microscopy (ssEM) with computational volume segmentation to reconstruct the complete 3D morphologies of distinct glial types in the mouse visual cortex. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the fine processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), a population of abundant, highly dynamic glial progenitors 4 , frequently surrounded terminal axon branches and included numerous phagolysosomes (PLs) containing fragments of axons and presynaptic terminals. Single- nucleus RNA sequencing indicated that cortical OPCs express key phagocytic genes, as well as neuronal transcripts, consistent with active axonal engulfment. PLs were ten times more abundant in OPCs than in microglia in P36 mice, and declined with age and lineage progression, suggesting that OPCs contribute very substantially to refinement of neuronal circuits during later phases of cortical development.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and antecedent factors associated with AD were explored using amyloid imaging and unbiased measures of longitudinal atrophy in combination with reanalysis of previous metabolic and functional studies. In total, data from 764 participants were compared across five in vivo imaging methods. Convergence of effects was seen in posterior cortical regions, including posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and lateral parietal cortex. These regions were active in default states in young adults and also showed amyloid deposition in older adults with AD. At early stages of AD progression, prominent atrophy and metabolic abnormalities emerged in these posterior cortical regions; atrophy in medial temporal regions was also observed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies further revealed that these cortical regions are active during successful memory retrieval in young adults. One possibility is that lifetime cerebral metabolism associated with regionally specific default activity predisposes cortical regions to AD-related changes, including amyloid deposition, metabolic disruption, and atrophy. These cortical regions may be part of a network with the medial temporal lobe whose disruption contributes to memory impairment.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that some brain areas act as hubs interconnecting distinct, functionally specialized systems. These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset (n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) because some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging in AD (n = 10) compared with older controls (n = 29) showed high amyloid-beta deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in AD.},

abstract = {Braak and colleagues have proposed that, within the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) begins as a synucleinopathy in nondopaminergic structures of the lower brainstem or in the olfactory bulb. The brainstem synucleinopathy is postulated to progress rostrally to affect the substantia nigra and cause parkinsonism at a later stage of the disease. In the context of a diagnosis of PD, made from current clinical criteria, the pattern of lower brainstem involvement accompanying mesencephalic synucleinopathy is often observed. However, outside of that context, the patterns of synucleinopathy that Braak described are often not observed, particularly in dementia with Lewy bodies and when synucleinopathy occurs in the absence of neurological manifestations. The concept that lower brainstem synucleinopathy represents "early PD" rests on the supposition that it has a substantial likelihood of progressing within the human lifetime to involve the mesencephalon, and thereby cause the substantia nigra pathology and clinical parkinsonism that have heretofore defined the disease. However, the predictive validity of this concept is doubtful, based on numerous observations made in populations of aged individuals who, despite the absence of neurological signs, have brain synucleinopathy ranging up to Braak stages 4 to 6 at postmortem. Furthermore, there is no relation between Braak stage and the clinical severity of PD. We conclude that the relation between patterns of abnormal synuclein immunostaining in the human brain and the disease entity now recognized as PD remains to be determined.},

However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unknown. By employing in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human A$\beta$ and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over A$\beta$-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both A$\beta$ and tau. Together, our results reveal how A$\beta$ and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-A$\beta$ therapeutic trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Activated microglia have a key role in the brain's immune response to neuronal degeneration. The transition of microglia from the normal resting state to the activated state is associated with an increased expression of receptors known as peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, which are abundant on cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We used brain imaging to study expression of these sites in healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS We studied 15 normal individuals (age 32-80 years), eight patients with Alzheimer's disease, and one patient with minimal cognitive impairment. Quantitative in-vivo measurements of glial activation were obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) and carbon-11-labelled (R)-PK11195, a specific ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. FINDINGS In normal individuals, regional [11C](R)-PK11195 binding did not significantly change with age, except in the thalamus, where an age-dependent increase was found. By contrast, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly increased regional [11C](R)-PK11195 binding in the entorhinal, temporoparietal, and cingulate cortex. INTERPRETATION In-vivo detection of increased [11C](R)-PK11195 binding in Alzheimer-type dementia, including mild and early forms, suggests that microglial activation is an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to improve the neuropathologic recognition and provide criteria for the pathological diagnosis in the neurodegenerative diseases grouped as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); revised criteria are proposed. Recent advances in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and neuropathology of FTLD prompted the Midwest Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and experts at other centers to review and revise the existing neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for FTLD. The proposed criteria for FTLD are based on existing criteria, which include the tauopathies [FTLD with Pick bodies, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, sporadic multiple system tauopathy with dementia, argyrophilic grain disease, neurofibrillary tangle dementia, and FTD with microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene mutation, also called FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)]. The proposed criteria take into account new disease entities and include the novel molecular pathology, TDP-43 proteinopathy, now recognized to be the most frequent histological finding in FTLD. TDP-43 is a major component of the pathologic inclusions of most sporadic and familial cases of FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular genetic studies of familial cases of FTLD-U have shown that mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are a major genetic cause of FTLD-U. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are present in rare familial forms of FTD, and some families with FTD and/or MND have been linked to chromosome 9p, and both are types of FTLD-U. Thus, familial TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with defects in multiple genes, and molecular genetics is required in these cases to correctly identify the causative gene defect. In addition to genetic heterogeneity amongst the TDP-43 proteinopathies, there is also neuropathologic heterogeneity and there is a close relationship between genotype and FTLD-U subtype. In addition to these recent significant advances in the neuropathology of FTLD-U, novel FTLD entities have been further characterized, including neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease. The proposed criteria incorporate up-to-date neuropathology of FTLD in the light of recent immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic advances. These criteria will be of value to the practicing neuropathologist and provide a foundation for clinical, clinico-pathologic, mechanistic studies and in vivo models of pathogenesis of FTLD. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease increasing evidence attributes synaptic and cognitive deficits to soluble oligomers of amyloid beta protein (Abeta), even prior to the accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal cell death. Here we show that within 1-2 h picomolar concentrations of cell-derived, soluble Abeta induce specific alterations in pre- and postsynaptic morphology and connectivity in cultured hippocampal neurons. Clusters of presynaptic vesicle markers decreased in size and number at glutamatergic but not GABAergic terminals. Dendritic spines also decreased in number and became dysmorphic, as spine heads collapsed and/or extended long protrusions. Simultaneous time-lapse imaging of axon-dendrite pairs revealed that shrinking spines sometimes became disconnected from their presynaptic varicosity. Concomitantly, miniature synaptic potentials decreased in amplitude and frequency. Spine changes were prevented by blockers of nAChRs and NMDARs. Washout of Abeta within the first day reversed these spine changes. Further, spine changes reversed spontaneously by 2 days, because neurons acutely developed resistance to continuous Abeta exposure. Thus, rapid Abeta-induced synapse destabilization may underlie transient behavioral impairments in animal models, and early cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's patients.},

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a powerful means to characterise structural connectivity non-invasively, by using a fibre-tracking algorithm. The most widely used fibre-tracking strategy is based on the step-wise generation of streamlines. Despite their popularity and widespread use, there are a number of practical considerations that must be taken into account in order to increase the robustness of streamlines tracking results, particularly when these methods are used to study brain structural connectivity, and the connectome. This review article describes what we consider the ‘seven deadly sins' of mapping structural connections using diffusion MRI streamlines fibre-tracking, with particular emphasis on ‘sins' that can be practically avoided and they can have an important impact in the results. It is shown that there are important ‘deadly sins' to be avoided at every step of the pipeline, such as during data acquisition, during data modelling to estimate local fibre architecture, during the fibre-tracking process itself, and during quantification of the tracking results. The recommendations here are intended to inform users on potential important shortcomings of their current tracking protocols, as well as to guide future users on some of the key issues and decisions that must be faced when designing their processing pipelines.},

METHODS In this study, 46 subjects (20 men and 26 women, mean age of 69.0 ± 7.6 years), including 13 with AD, 12 with MCI and 21 HC subjects, were enrolled from three academic memory clinics. PET images were acquired over a 10-min period 50 min after injection of florbetapir (mean ± SD of radioactivity injected, 259 ± 57 MBq). PET images were assessed visually by two individuals blinded to any clinical information and quantitatively via the standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in the specific regions of interest, which were defined in relation to the cerebellum as the reference region. RESULTS The mean values of SUVr were higher in AD patients (median 1.20, Q1-Q3 1.16-1.30) than in HC subjects (median 1.05, Q1-Q3 1.04-1.08; p = 0.0001) in the overall cortex and all cortical regions (precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulate, and frontal median, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex). The MCI subjects also showed a higher uptake of florbetapir in the posterior cingulate cortex (median 1.06, Q1-Q3 0.97-1.28) compared with HC subjects (median 0.95, Q1-Q3 0.82-1.02; p = 0.03). Qualitative visual assessment of the PET scans showed a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% CI 0.55-0.98) and a specificity of 38.1% (95% CI 0.18-0.62) for discriminating AD patients from HC subjects; however, the quantitative assessment of the global cortex SUVr showed a sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 90.5% with a cut-off value of 1.122 (area under the curve 0.894). CONCLUSION These preliminary results suggest that PET with florbetapir is a safe and suitable biomarker for AD that can be used routinely in a clinical environment. However, the low specificity of the visual PET scan assessment could be improved by the use of specific training and automatic or semiautomatic quantification tools.},

abstract = {Protein misfolding refers to a process where proteins become structurally abnormal and lose their specific 3-dimensional spatial configuration. The histopathological presence of misfolded protein (MP) aggregates has been associated as the primary evidence of multiple neurological diseases, including Prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. However, the exact mechanisms of MP aggregation and propagation, as well as their impact in the long-term patient's clinical condition are still not well understood. With this aim, a variety of mathematical models has been proposed for a better insight into the kinetic rate laws that govern the microscopic processes of protein aggregation. Complementary, another class of large-scale models rely on modern molecular imaging techniques for describing the phenomenological effects of MP propagation over the whole brain. Unfortunately, those neuroimaging-based studies do not take full advantage of the tremendous capabilities offered by the chemical kinetics modeling approach. Actually, it has been barely acknowledged that the vast majority of large-scale models have foundations on previous mathematical approaches that describe the chemical kinetics of protein replication and propagation. The purpose of the current manuscript is to present a historical review about the development of mathematical models for describing both microscopic processes that occur during the MP aggregation and large-scale events that characterize the progression of neurodegenerative MP-mediated diseases.},

abstract = {Most neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the presence of protein aggregates. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people over age 60. One of the histopathological hallmarks of AD is the presence of tau protein aggregates. Historically, it has been thought that paired helical filaments (PHFs) were the toxic form of tau that assembled to form neuro fibrillary tangles (NFTs), but recently there has been evidence that tau oligomers, which form before PHFs and NFTs, could be the structures mediating neurodegeneration even before the fibrillary tau is deposited. Here, we discuss the recent advances in tau oligomer research, their implications on AD and other tauopathies, the mechanisms of tau turnover by the principal protein clearance systems (the proteasome and autophagy), and the potential use of tau oligomers as drug targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

abstract = {Herpes simplex is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and viral infection produces Alzheimer's disease like pathology in mice. The virus expresses proteins containing short contiguous amino acid stretches (5–9aa “vatches” = viralmatches) homologous to APOE4, clusterin, PICALM, and complement receptor 1, and to over 100 other gene products relevant to Alzheimer's disease, which are also homologous to proteins expressed by other pathogens implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Such homology, reiterated at the DNA level, suggests that gene association studies have been tracking infection, as well as identifying key genes, demonstrating a role for pathogens as causative agents. Vatches may interfere with the function of their human counterparts, acting as dummy ligands, decoy receptors, or via interactome interference. They are often immunogenic, and antibodies generated in response to infection may target their human counterparts, producing protein knockdown, or generating autoimmune responses that may kill the neurones in which the human homologue resides, a scenario supported by immune activation in Alzheimer's disease. These data may classify Alzheimer's disease as an autoimmune disorder created by pathogen mimicry of key Alzheimer's disease-related proteins. It may well be prevented by vaccination and regular pathogen detection and elimination, and perhaps stemmed by immunosuppression or antibody adsorption-related therapies.},

abstract = {The major Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes (APOE, clusterin, complement receptor 1 (CR1) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein, PICALM) can be implicated directly (APOE, CR1) or indirectly (clusterin and PICALM) in the herpes simplex life cycle. The virus binds to proteoliposomes containing APOE or APOA1 and also to CR1, and both clusterin and PICALM are related to a mannose-6-phosphate receptor used by the virus for cellular entry and intracellular transport. PICALM also binds to a nuclear exportin used by the virus for nuclear egress. Clusterin and complement receptor 1 are both related to the complement pathways and play a general role in pathogen defence. In addition, the amyloid precursor protein APP is involved in herpes viral transport and gamma-secretase cleaves a number of receptors used by the virus for cellular entry. APOE, APOA1 and clusterin, or alpha 2-macroglobulin, insulysin and caspase 3, which also bind to the virus, are involved in beta-amyloid clearance or degradation, as are the viral binding complement components, C3 and CR1. There are multiple ways in which the products of key susceptibility genes might be able to modify the viral life cycle and in turn the virus interacts with key proteins involved in APP and beta-amyloid processing. These interactions support a role for the herpes simplex virus in Alzheimer's disease pathology and suggest that antiviral agents or vaccination might be considered as viable therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease.},

Such pathogens promote beta-amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation and may thus be causative agents, whose effects are conditioned by genes. The antimicrobial effects of beta-amyloid, the localisation of APP/gamma-secretase in immunocompetent dendritic cells, and gamma secretase cleavage of numerous pathogen receptors suggest that this network is concerned with pathogen disposal, effects which may be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the elderly. These autoantibodies, as well as those to nerve growth factor and tau , also observed in Alzheimer's disease, may well be antibodies to pathogens, due to homology between human autoantigens and pathogen proteins. NGF or tau antibodies promote beta-amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, or cholinergic neuronal loss, and, with other autoantibodies, such as anti-ATPase, are potential agents of destruction, whose formation is dictated by sequence homology between pathogen and human proteins, and thus by pathogen strain and human genes. Pathogen elimination in the ageing population and removal of culpable autoantibodies might reduce the incidence and offer hope for a cure in this affliction.},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), the correlation between disability and the volume of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually weak. This may be because lesion location also influences the extent and type of functional disability. We applied an automatic lesion-detection algorithm to 452 MRI scans of patients with relapsing-remitting MS to identify the regions preferentially responsible for different types of clinical deficits. Statistical parametric maps were generated by performing voxel-wise linear regressions between lesion probability and different clinical disability scores. There was a clear distinction between lesion locations causing physical and cognitive disability. Lesion likelihood correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in the left internal capsule and in periventricular white matter mostly in the left hemisphere. Pyramidal deficits correlated with only one area in the left internal capsule that was also present in the EDSS correlation. Cognitive dysfunction correlated with lesion location at the grey-white junction of associative, limbic, and prefrontal cortex. Coordination impairment correlated with areas in interhemispheric and pyramidal periventricular white matter tracts, and in the inferior and superior longitudinal fascicles. Bowel and bladder scores correlated with lesions in the medial frontal lobes, cerebellum, insula, dorsal midbrain, and pons, areas known to be involved in the control of micturition. This study demonstrates for the first time a relationship between the site of lesions and the type of disability in large scale MRI data set in MS.},

abstract = {Organelles, proteins, and mRNA are transported bidirectionally along microtubules by plus-end directed kinesin and minus-end directed dynein motors. Microtubules are decorated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that organize the cytoskeleton, regulate microtubule dynamics and modulate the interaction between motor proteins and microtubules to direct intracellular transport. Tau is a neuronal MAP that stabilizes axonal microtubules and crosslinks them into bundles. Dysregulation of tau leads to a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau reduces the processivity of kinesin and dynein by acting as an obstacle on the microtubule. Single-molecule assays indicate that kinesin-1 is more strongly inhibited than kinesin-2 or dynein, suggesting tau might act to spatially modulate the activity of specific motors. To investigate the role of tau in regulating bidirectional transport, we isolated phagosomes driven by kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein and reconstituted their motility along microtubules. We find that tau biases bidirectional motility towards the microtubule minus-end in a dose-dependent manner. Optical trapping measurements show that tau increases the magnitude and frequency of forces exerted by dynein through inhibiting opposing kinesin motors. Mathematical modeling indicates that tau controls the directional bias of intracellular cargoes through differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau modulates motility in a motor-specific manner to direct intracellular transport, and suggests that dysregulation of tau might contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the balance of plus- and minus-end directed transport.},

abstract = {Human and animal studies show that mammalian brains undergo massive synaptic pruning during childhood, losing about half of the synapses by puberty. We have previously shown that maintaining the network performance while synapses are deleted requires that synapses be properly modified and pruned, with the weaker synapses removed. We now show that neuronal regulation, a mechanism recently observed to maintain the average neuronal input field of a postsynaptic neuron, results in a weight-dependent synaptic modification. Under the correct range of the degradation dimension and synaptic upper bound, neuronal regulation removes the weaker synapses and judiciously modifies the remaining synapses. By deriving optimal synaptic modification functions in an excitatory-inhibitory network, we prove that neuronal regulation implements near-optimal synaptic modification and maintains the performance of a network undergoing massive synaptic pruning. These findings support the possibility that neural regulation complements the action of Hebbian synaptic changes in the self-organization of the developing brain.},

We propose a voxel-based Bayesian method for lesion-deficit analysis, which identifies complex linear or nonlinear associations among brain-lesion locations, and neurological status. We validated this method using a simulated data set, and we applied this algorithm to data obtained from an acute-stroke study to identify associations among voxels with infarct or hypoperfusion, and impaired word reading. We found that a distributed region involving Brodmann areas (BA) 22, 37, 39, and 40 was implicated in word reading.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related devastating neurodegenerative disorder, which severely impacts on the global economic development and healthcare system. Though AD has been studied for more than 100 years since 1906, the exact cause(s) and pathogenic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. Also, the efficient disease-modifying treatment and ideal diagnostic method for AD are unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, an invariant pathophysiological feature of AD, may be a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review, we firstly discussed the features of cerebral glucose metabolism in physiological and pathological conditions. Then, we further reviewed the contribution of glucose transportation abnormality and intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction in AD pathophysiology, and proposed a hypothesis that multiple pathogenic cascades induced by impaired cerebral glucose metabolism could result in neuronal degeneration and consequently cognitive deficits in AD patients. Among these pathogenic processes, altered functional status of thiamine metabolism and brain insulin resistance are highly emphasized and characterized as major pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, considering the fact that AD patients exhibit cerebral glucose hypometabolism possibly due to impairments of insulin signaling and altered thiamine metabolism, we also discuss some potential possibilities to uncover diagnostic biomarkers for AD from abnormal glucose metabolism and to develop drugs targeting at repairing insulin signaling impairment and correcting thiamine metabolism abnormality. We conclude that glucose metabolism abnormality plays a critical role in AD pathophysiological alterations through the induction of multiple pathogenic factors such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so forth. To clarify the causes, pathogeneses and consequences of cerebral hypometabolism in AD will help break the bottleneck of current AD study in finding ideal diagnostic biomarker and disease-modifying therapy.},

abstract = {Although the patterns of structural and metabolic brain alterations in Alzheimer's disease are being refined and discrepancies between them are being underlined, the exact relationships between atrophy and hypometabolism are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to provide a direct comparison between grey matter atrophy and hypometabolism in a sample of patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's disease, using a voxel-based method specially designed to statistically compare the two imaging modalities. Eighteen patients with probable Alzheimer's disease of mild severity and 15 healthy aged controls underwent both high-resolution T1 MRI and resting-state (18)FDG-PET. The MRI data sets were handled using optimized VBM. The PET data were coregistered to their corresponding MRI, corrected voxel-wise for partial volume averaging and spatially normalized using the same parameters as those of their corresponding MRI volume. A differential smoothing was applied on the MRI and PET data sets to equalize their effective smoothness and resolution. For each patient, Z-score maps of atrophy and hypometabolism were created by comparing to the controls data set, respectively averaged to provide the profile of hypometabolism and atrophy, and entered in a voxel-by-voxel SPM analysis to assess the statistical differences between hypometabolism and atrophy. The observed patterns of hypometabolism and atrophy were consistent with previous studies. However, the direct comparison revealed marked regional variability in the relationship between hypometabolism and atrophy. Thus, the hypometabolism significantly exceeded atrophy in most altered structures, particularly in the posterior cingulate-precuneus, orbitofrontal, inferior temporo-parietal, parahippocampal, angular and fusiform areas. In contrast, a few hypometabolic structures among which the hippocampus exhibited similar degrees of atrophy and hypometabolism, a profile that significantly differed from the posterior cingulate. Excessive hypometabolism relative to atrophy suggests the intervention of additional hypometabolism-inducing factors, such as disconnection and amyloid deposition, resulting in genuine functional perturbation ahead of actual atrophy and perhaps of pathology as well. Conversely, in the hippocampus, where disconnection processes are also likely to occur, relative synaptic compensatory mechanisms may be taking place, maintaining neuronal activity in the face of structural alterations.},

abstract = {The thalamus is a key cerebral hub relaying a multitude of corticoefferent and corticoafferent connections and mediating distinct extrapyramidal, sensory, cognitive and behavioural functions. While the thalamus consists of dozens of anatomically well-defined nuclei with distinctive physiological roles, existing imaging studies in motor neuron diseases typically evaluate the thalamus as a single structure. Based on the unique cortical signatures observed in ALS and PLS, we hypothesised that similarly focal thalamic involvement may be observed if the nuclei are individually evaluated. A prospective imaging study was undertaken with 100 patients with ALS, 33 patients with PLS and 117 healthy controls to characterise the integrity of thalamic nuclei. ALS patients were further stratified for the presence of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72. The thalamus was segmented into individual nuclei to examine their volumetric profile. Additionally, thalamic shape deformations were evaluated by vertex analyses and focal density alterations were examined by region-of-interest morphometry. Our data indicate that C9orf72 negative ALS patients and PLS patients exhibit ventral lateral and ventral anterior involvement, consistent with the 'motor' thalamus. Degeneration of the sensory nuclei was also detected in C9orf72 negative ALS and PLS. Both ALS groups and the PLS cohort showed focal changes in the mediodorsal-paratenial-reuniens nuclei, which mediate memory and executive functions. PLS patients exhibited distinctive thalamic changes with marked pulvinar and lateral geniculate atrophy compared to both controls and C9orf72 negative ALS. The considerable ventral lateral and ventral anterior pathology detected in both ALS and PLS support the emerging literature of extrapyramidal dysfunction in MND. The involvement of sensory nuclei is consistent with sporadic reports of sensory impairment in MND. The unique thalamic signature of PLS is in line with the distinctive clinical features of the phenotype. Our data confirm phenotype-specific patterns of thalamus involvement in motor neuron diseases with the preferential involvement of nuclei mediating motor and cognitive functions. Given the selective involvement of thalamic nuclei in ALS and PLS, future biomarker and natural history studies in MND should evaluate individual thalamic regions instead overall thalamic changes.},

abstract = {Objective To determine the in vivo cortical spreading pattern of tau and amyloid and to establish positron emission tomography (PET) image‐based tau staging in the Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum. Methods We included 195 participants (53 AD, 52 amnestic mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 23 nonamnestic MCI, and 67 healthy controls) who underwent 2 PET scans (18F‐florbetaben for amyloid‐$\beta$ and 18F‐AV‐1451 for tau). We assumed that regions with earlier appearances of pathology may show increased binding in a greater number of participants and acquired spreading order of tau accumulation by sorting the regional frequencies of involvement. We classified each participant into image‐based tau stage based on the Z score of the composite region for each stage. Results Tau accumulation was most frequently observed in the medial temporal regions and spread stepwise to the basal and lateral temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate, and other association cortices, and then ultimately to the primary cortical regions. In contrast, amyloid accumulation was found with similar frequency in the diffuse neocortical areas and then finally spread to the medial temporal regions. The image‐based tau stage correlated with the general cognitive status, whereas cortical thinning was found only in the advanced tau stages: medial temporal region in stage V and widespread cortex in stage VI. Interpretation Our PET study replicated postmortem spreading patterns of tau and amyloid‐$\beta$ pathologies. Unlike the diffuse accumulation of amyloid throughout the neocortex, tau spreading occurred in a stepwise fashion through the networks. Image‐based tau staging may be useful for the objective assessment of AD progression. Ann Neurol 2016;80:247–258},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the topographical distribution of tau pathology and its effect on functional and structural changes in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by using (18)F-AV-1451 PET. METHODS We included 20 patients with AD, 15 patients with MCI, and 20 healthy controls, and performed neuropsychological function tests, MRI, as well as (18)F-florbetaben (for amyloid) and (18)F-AV-1451 (for tau) PET scans. By using the regional volume-of-interest masks extracted from MRIs, regional binding values of standardized uptake value ratios and volumes were measured. We compared regional binding values among 3 diagnostic groups and identified correlations among the regional binding values, performance in each cognitive function test, and regional atrophy. RESULTS (18)F-AV-1451 binding was increased only in the entorhinal cortex in patients with MCI, while patients with AD exhibited greater binding in most cortical regions. In the 35 patients with MCI and AD, (18)F-AV-1451 binding in most of the neocortex increased with a worsening of global cognitive function. The visual and verbal memory functions were associated with the extent of (18)F-AV-1451 binding, especially in the medial temporal regions. The (18)F-AV-1451 binding also correlated with the severity of regional atrophy of the cerebral cortex. CONCLUSIONS Tau PET imaging with (18)F-AV-1451 could serve as an in vivo biomarker for the evaluation of AD-related tau pathology and monitoring disease progression. The accumulation of pathologic tau is more closely related to functional and structural deterioration in the AD spectrum than $\beta$-amyloid.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) changes in non-demented amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with or without cognitive impairment (ALS-motor and ALS-plus, respectively). Nineteen ALS-motor, 31 ALS-plus and 25 healthy controls (HC) underwent 3D-T1-weighted and 30-directional diffusion-weighted imaging on a 3 T MRI scanner. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial-statistics analysis were performed to examine GM volume (GMV) changes and WM differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD, respectively). Compared to HC, ALS-motor patients showed decreased GMV in frontal and cerebellar areas and increased GMV in right supplementary motor area, while ALS-plus patients showed diffuse GMV reduction in primary motor cortex bilaterally, frontotemporal areas, cerebellum and basal ganglia. ALS-motor patients had increased GMV in left precuneus compared to ALS-plus patients. We also found decreased FA and increased RD in the corticospinal tract bilaterally, the corpus callosum and extra-motor tracts in ALS-motor patients, and decreased FA and increased AD and RD in motor and several WM tracts in ALS-plus patients, compared to HC. Multimodal neuroimaging confirms motor and extra-motor GM and WM abnormalities in non-demented cognitively-impaired ALS patients (ALS-plus) and identifies early extra-motor brain pathology in ALS patients without cognitive impairment (ALS-motor).},

abstract = {The progressive loss of the nigrostriatal pathway is a distinguishing feature of Parkinson's disease. As terminal field loss seems to precede cell body loss, we tested whether alterations of axonal transport motor proteins would be early features in Parkinson's disease. There was a decline in axonal transport motor proteins in sporadic Parkinson's disease that preceded other well-known nigral cell-related pathology such as phenotypic downregulation of dopamine. Reductions in conventional kinesin levels precede the alterations in dopaminergic phenotypic markers (tyrosine hydroxylase) in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. This reduction was significantly greater in nigral neurons containing $\alpha$-synuclein inclusions. Unlike conventional kinesin, reductions in the levels of the cytoplasmic dynein light chain Tctex type 3 subunit were only observed at late Parkinson's disease stages. Reductions in levels of conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein subunits were recapitulated in a rat genetic Parkinson's disease model based on over-expression of human mutant a-synuclein (A30P). Together, our data suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation is a key feature associated with reductions of axonal transport motor proteins in Parkinson's disease and support the hypothesis that dopaminergic neurodegeneration following a 'dying-back' pattern involving axonal transport disruption. {\textcopyright} The Author (2012).

abstract = {Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally aggregated in neuronal and glial cells in a range of neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively referred to as tauopathies. Multiple studies have suggested that pathological tau species may act as a seed that promotes aggregation of endogenous tau in na{\"{i}}ve cells and contributes to propagation of tau pathology. While they share pathological tau aggregation as a common feature, tauopathies are distinct from one another with respect to predominant tau isoforms that accumulate and the selective vulnerability of brain regions and cell types that have tau inclusions. For instance, primary tauopathies present with glial tau pathology, while it is mostly neuronal in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, morphologies of tau inclusions can greatly vary even within the same cell type, suggesting distinct mechanisms or distinct tau conformers in each tauopathy. Neuropathological heterogeneity across tauopathies challenges our understanding of pathophysiology behind tau seeding and aggregation, as well as our efforts to develop effective therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies. In this review, we describe diverse neuropathological features of tau inclusions in neurodegenerative tauopathies and discuss what has been learned from experimental studies with mouse models, advanced transcriptomics, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on the biology underlying cell type-specific tau pathology.},

abstract = {Working memory requires efficient excitatory drive to parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Developmental pruning eliminates superfluous excitatory inputs, suggesting that working memory maturation during adolescence requires pruning of excitatory inputs to PV interneurons. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that excitatory synapses on PV interneurons are pruned during adolescence. The density of excitatory synapses, defined by overlapping vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive (VGlut1+) and postsynaptic density 95-positive (PSD95+) puncta, on PV interneurons was lower in postpubertal relative to prepubertal monkeys. In contrast, puncta levels of VGlut1 and PSD95 proteins were higher in postpubertal monkeys and positively predicted activity-dependent PV levels, suggesting a greater strength of the remaining synapses after pruning. Because excitatory synapse number on PV interneurons is regulated by erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), whose function is influenced by alternative splicing, we tested the hypothesis that pruning of excitatory synapses on PV interneurons is associated with developmental shifts in ErbB4 expression and/or splicing. Pan-ErbB4 expression did not change, whereas the minor-to-major splice variant ratios increased with age. In cell culture, the major, but not the minor, variant increased excitatory synapse number on PV interneurons and displayed greater kinase activity than the minor variant, suggesting that the effect of ErbB4 signaling in PV interneurons is mediated by alternative splicing. Supporting this interpretation, in monkey DLPFC, higher minor-to-major variant ratios predicted lower PSD95+ puncta density on PV interneurons. Together, our findings suggest that ErbB4 splicing may regulate the pruning of excitatory synapses on PV interneurons during adolescence.},

Abeta aggregation is concentration dependent and brain region specific. Utilizing in vivo microdialysis concurrently with field potential recordings, we demonstrate that Abeta levels in the brain interstitial fluid are dynamically and directly influenced by synaptic activity on a timescale of minutes to hours. Using an acute brain slice model, we show that the rapid effects of synaptic activity on Abeta levels are primarily related to synaptic vesicle exocytosis. These results suggest that synaptic activity may modulate a neurodegenerative disease process, in this case by influencing Abeta metabolism and ultimately region-specific Abeta deposition. The findings also have important implications for treatment development.},

In Alzheimer's disease and AGD, it has been shown that filamentous tau appears to spread in a stereotypic manner as the disease progresses. We previously demonstrated that the injection of brain extracts from human mutant P301S tau-expressing transgenic mice into the brains of mice transgenic for wild-type human tau (line ALZ17) resulted in the assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and the spreading of tau inclusions from the injection sites to anatomically connected brain regions. Here we injected brain extracts from humans who had died with various tauopathies into the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of ALZ17 mice. Argyrophilic tau inclusions formed in all cases and following the injection of the corresponding brain extracts, we recapitulated the hallmark lesions of AGD, PSP and CBD. Similar inclusions also formed after intracerebral injection of brain homogenates from human tauopathies into nontransgenic mice. Moreover, the induced formation of tau aggregates could be propagated between mouse brains. These findings suggest that once tau aggregates have formed in discrete brain areas, they become self-propagating and spread in a prion-like manner.},

abstract = {Hyperphosphorylated tau makes up the filamentous intracellular inclusions of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In the disease process, neuronal tau inclusions first appear in the transentorhinal cortex from where they seem to spread to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Cognitive impairment becomes manifest when inclusions reach the hippocampus, with abundant neocortical tau inclusions and extracellular $\beta$-amyloid deposits being the defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. An abundance of tau inclusions, in the absence of $\beta$-amyloid deposits, defines Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and other diseases. Tau mutations cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, establishing that tau protein dysfunction is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. Thus, transgenic mice expressing mutant (for example, P301S) human tau in nerve cells show the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration and abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. By contrast, mouse lines expressing single isoforms of wild-type human tau do not produce tau filaments or show neurodegeneration. Here we have used tau-expressing lines to investigate whether experimental tauopathy can be transmitted. We show that injection of brain extract from mutant P301S tau-expressing mice into the brain of transgenic wild-type tau-expressing animals induces assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and spreading of pathology from the site of injection to neighbouring brain regions.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain. Another feature is represented by the formation in these cells of inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB), principally constituted by fibrillar $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$Syn). This protein is considered a key element in the aetiology of a group of neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, which include PD, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are not completely clear. It is established that the inflammatory process plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of PD; moreover, it is known that aggregated $\alpha$Syn, released by neurons, activates microglia cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1$\beta$. IL-1$\beta$ is one of the strongest pro-inflammatory cytokines; it is produced as an inactive mediator, and its maturation and activation requires inflammasome activation. In particular, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, among which are crystallized and particulate material. In this work, we investigated the possibility that IL-1$\beta$ production, induced by fibrillar $\alpha$Syn, is involved the inflammasome activation. We demonstrated the competence of monomeric and fibrillar $\alpha$Syn to induce synthesis of IL-1$\beta$, through TLR2 interaction; we found that the secretion of the mature cytokine was a peculiarity of the fibrillated protein. Moreover, we observed that the secretion of IL-1$\beta$ involves NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The latter relies on the phagocytosis of fibrillar $\alpha$Syn, followed by increased ROS production and cathepsin B release into the cytosol. Taken together, our data support the notion that fibrillar $\alpha$Syn, likely released by neuronal degeneration, acts as an endogenous trigger inducing a strong inflammatory response in PD.},

However, this relationship has not been well studied in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or amyloid-positive controls. Here, we explored associations of Abeta deposition with metabolism via both region-of-interest-based and voxel-based analyses in amyloid-positive control subjects and patients with MCI or AD. Metabolism in parietal and precuneus cortices of AD patients was negatively correlated with PiB retention locally, and more distantly with PiB retention in frontal cortex. In amyloid-positive controls, no clear patterns in correlations were observed. In MCI patients, there were essentially no significant, negative correlations, but there were frequent significant positive correlations between metabolism and PiB retention. Metabolism in anterior cingulate showed positive correlations with PiB in most brain areas in MCI, and metabolism and PiB retention were positively correlated locally in precuneus/parietal cortex. However, there was no significant increase in metabolism in MCI compared to age-matched controls, negating the possibility that Abeta deposition directly caused reactive hypermetabolism. This suggests that, in MCI, higher basal metabolism could either be exacerbating Abeta deposition or increasing the level of Abeta necessary for cognitive impairment sufficient for the clinical diagnosis of AD. Only after extensive Abeta deposition has been present for longer periods of time does Abeta become the driving force for decreased metabolism in clinical AD and, only in more vulnerable brain regions such as parietal and precuneus cortices.},

We have examined the combined associations of $\alpha$-synuclein, tau and amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation in 56 pathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease cases, 29 of whom had developed dementia. Cortical and subcortical amyloid-$\beta$ scores were obtained, while tau and $\alpha$-synuclein pathologies were rated according to the respective Braak stages. Additionally, cortical Lewy body and Lewy neurite scores were determined and Lewy body densities were generated using morphometry. Non-parametric statistics, together with regression models, receiver-operating characteristic curves and survival analyses were applied. Cortical and striatal amyloid-$\beta$ scores, Braak tau stages, cortical Lewy body, Lewy neurite scores and Lewy body densities, but not Braak $\alpha$-synuclein stages, were all significantly greater in the Parkinson's disease-dementia group (P<0.05), with all the pathologies showing a significant positive correlation to each other (P<0.05). A combination of pathologies [area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve=0.95 (0.88-1.00); P<0.0001] was a better predictor of dementia than the severity of any single pathology. Additionally, cortical amyloid-$\beta$ scores (r=-0.62; P=0.043) and Braak tau stages (r=-0.52; P=0.028), but not Lewy body scores (r=-0.25; P=0.41) or Braak $\alpha$-synuclein stages (r=-0.44; P=0.13), significantly correlated with mini-mental state examination scores in the subset of cases with this information available within the last year of life (n=15). High cortical amyloid-$\beta$ score (P=0.017) along with an older age at onset (P=0.001) were associated with a shorter time-to-dementia period. A combination of Lewy- and Alzheimer-type pathologies is a robust pathological correlate of dementia in Parkinson's disease, with quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of Lewy pathology being more informative than Braak $\alpha$-synuclein stages. Cortical amyloid-$\beta$ and age at disease onset seem to determine the rate to dementia.},

The AWV requires an assessment to detect cognitive impairment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) elected not to recommend a specific assessment tool because there is no single, universally accepted screen that satisfies all needs in the detection of cognitive impairment. To provide primary care physicians with guidance on cognitive assessment during the AWV, and when referral or further testing is needed, the Alzheimer's Association convened a group of experts to develop recommendations. The resulting Alzheimer's Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition includes review of patient Health Risk Assessment (HRA) information, patient observation, unstructured queries during the AWV, and use of structured cognitive assessment tools for both patients and informants. Widespread implementation of this algorithm could be the first step in reducing the prevalence of missed or delayed dementia diagnosis, thus allowing for better healthcare management and more favorable outcomes for affected patients and their families and caregivers.},

Thus APOE-epsilon 4 gene dose is a major risk factor for late onset AD and, in these families, homozygosity for APOE-epsilon 4 was virtually sufficient to cause AD by age 80.},

abstract = {The distinctive morphology of neurons, with complex dendritic arbors and extensive axons, presents spatial challenges for intracellular signal transduction. The endosomal system provides mechanisms that enable signaling molecules initiated by extracellular cues to be trafficked throughout the expanse of the neuron, allowing intracellular signals to be sustained over long distances. Therefore endosomes are critical for many aspects of neuronal signaling that regulate cell survival, axonal growth and guidance, dendritic branching, and cell migration. An intriguing characteristic of neuronal signal transduction is that endosomal trafficking enables physiological responses that vary based on the subcellular location of signal initiation. In this review, we will discuss the specialized mechanisms and the functional significance of endosomal signaling in neurons, both during normal development and in disease.},

abstract = {Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be established. This article introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster_roi/.},

abstract = {Using a human amyloid beta (Abeta) intracerebroventricular infusion mouse model of Alzheimer's disease-related injury, we previously demonstrated that systemic administration of a glial activation inhibitor could suppress neuroinflammation, prevent synaptic damage, and attenuate hippocampal-dependent behavioral deficits. We report that Abeta-induced neuroinflammation is an early event associated with onset and progression of pathophysiology, can be suppressed by the glial inhibitor over a range of intervention start times, and is amenable to suppression without inhibiting peripheral tissue inflammatory responses. Specifically, hippocampal neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration occur in close time proximity at 4-6 weeks after the start of infusion. Intraperitoneal administration of inhibitor for 2-week intervals starting at various times after initiation of Abeta infusion suppresses progression of pathophysiology. The glial inhibitor is a selective suppressor of neuroinflammation, in that it does not block peripheral tissue production of proinflammatory cytokines or markers of B- and T-cell activation after a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. These results support a causal link between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, have important implications for future therapeutic development, and provide insight into the relative time window for targeting neuroinflammation with positive neurological outcomes.},

abstract = {We recommend a new term, "primary age-related tauopathy" (PART), to describe a pathology that is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques. For these "NFT+/A$\beta$-" brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as "tangle-only dementia" and "tangle-predominant senile dementia", are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of A$\beta$ accumulation. For both researchers and clinicians, a revised nomenclature will raise awareness of this extremely common pathologic change while providing a conceptual foundation for future studies. Prior reports that have elucidated features of the pathologic entity we refer to as PART are discussed, and working neuropathological diagnostic criteria are proposed.},

We found an overlap of macrostructural and microstructural damage in both patient groups compared with healthy controls, involving the right orbital and the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. The quantification of gray and white matter damage within the areas of shared alterations highlighted a higher degree of atrophy in orbitofrontal and frontomedial regions in patients with more severe executive and/or behavioral symptoms, and a higher degree of degeneration in the motor pathway in patients with more severe motor neuron disorders. Our finding provides additional evidence confirming the FTD-ALS continuum hypothesis and supports the notion of a bimodal but convergent pattern of neurostructural changes characterizing bvFTD and ALS.},

abstract = {Pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT and GRN have previously been linked to familial early onset forms of dementia. Mutation screening in these genes has been performed in either very small series or in single families with late onset AD (LOAD). Similarly, studies in single families have reported mutations in MAPT and GRN associated with clinical AD but no systematic screen of a large dataset has been performed to determine how frequently this occurs. We report sequence data for 439 probands from late-onset AD families with a history of four or more affected individuals. Sixty sequenced individuals (13.7%) carried a novel or pathogenic mutation. Eight pathogenic variants, (one each in APP and MAPT, two in PSEN1 and four in GRN) three of which are novel, were found in 14 samples. Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.21; 95%CI = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.19; 95%CI = 1.347-3.26). Rare coding variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, increase risk for or cause late onset AD. The presence of variants in these genes in LOAD and early-onset AD demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with AD. MAPT and GRN mutations can be found in clinical series of AD most likely due to misdiagnosis. This study clearly demonstrates that rare variants in these genes could explain an important proportion of genetic heritability of AD, which is not detected by GWAS.},

abstract = {Defective axonal transport has been proposed as an underlying mechanism that may give rise to neurodegeneration. We investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the axonal transport of tau, a neuronal protein that stabilizes microtubules and is hyperphosphorylated and mislocalized in Alzheimer's disease. We report here that specific inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) reduces tau phosphorylation and significantly decreases the overall rate of axonal transport of tau in rat cortical neurons. Tau mutants, with serine/threonine targets of GSK-3 mutated to glutamate to mimic a permanent state of phosphorylation, were transported at a significantly increased rate compared to wild-type tau. Conversely, tau mutants, in which alanine replaced serine/threonine to mimic permanent dephosphorylation, were transported at a decreased rate compared to wild-type tau. We also found that tau interacts with the light chain of kinesin-1 and that this is dependent on the phosphorylation state of tau. Tau phosphorylation by GSK-3 increased binding, and dephosphorylated tau exhibited a reduced association with kinesin-1. We conclude that GSK-3 phosphorylation of tau modulates its axonal transport by regulating binding to kinesin-1. Hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease appearing first in distal portions of axons may result from aberrant axonal transport of phosphorylated tau reported here.},

Methods: The National Institute on Aging—Alzheimer's Association Framework is considered as it applies to clinical trials. Results: Using the combination of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers, the Framework provides a means of defining the state of patients with regard to Alzheimer pathologic change. The Framework is relevant to clinical trials of disease-modifying agents, allowing participants to be characterized biologically at baseline. The ATN Framework can also inform trial outcomes. The preclinical phase of the disease after amyloid deposition is defined by A+T−N− and the transition to prodromal disease and dementia is characterized by the addition of T and N. Most symptomatic patients in clinical trials are in the class of A+T+N− and A+T+N+. Discussion: The National Institute on Aging—Alzheimer's Association Framework on AD represents progress in providing biomarker profiles of participants in the AD spectrum that can be used to help design clinical trials.},

abstract = {Prions are proteins that access self-templating amyloid forms, which confer phenotypic changes that can spread from individual to individual within or between species. These infectious phenotypes can be beneficial, as with yeast prions, or deleterious, as with mammalian prions that transmit spongiform encephalopathies. However, the ability to form self-templating amyloid is not unique to prion proteins. Diverse polypeptides that tend to populate intrinsically unfolded states also form self-templating amyloid conformers that are associated with devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, two RNA-binding proteins, FUS and TDP-43, which form cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, harbor a ‘prion domain' similar to those found in several yeast prion proteins. Can these proteins and the neurodegenerative diseases to which they are linked become ‘infectious' too? Here, we highlight advances that define the transmissibility of amyloid forms connected with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Collectively, these findings suggest that amyloid conformers can spread from cell to cell within the brains of afflicted individuals, thereby spreading the specific neurodegenerative phenotypes distinctive to the protein being converted to amyloid. Importantly, this transmissibility mandates a re-evaluation of emerging neuronal graft and stem-cell therapies. In this Commentary, we suggest how these treatments might be optimized to overcome the transmissible conformers that confer neurodegeneration.},

Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE $\epsilon$4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of A$\beta$1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the histopathological presence of amyloid-$\beta$ plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Microglial activation is also a recognized pathological component. The relationship between microglial activation and protein aggregation is still debated. We investigated the relationship between amyloid plaques, tau tangles and activated microglia using PET imaging. Fifty-one subjects (19 healthy controls, 16 mild cognitive impairment and 16 Alzheimer's disease subjects) participated in the study. All subjects had neuropsychometric testing, MRI, amyloid (18F-flutemetamol), and microglial (11C-PBR28) PET. All subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and eight of the controls had tau (18F-AV1451) PET. 11C-PBR28 PET was analysed using Logan graphical analysis with an arterial plasma input function, while 18F-flutemetamol and 18F-AV1451 PET were analysed as target:cerebellar ratios to create parametric standardized uptake value ratio maps. Biological parametric mapping in the Statistical Parametric Mapping platform was used to examine correlations between uptake of tracers at a voxel-level. There were significant widespread clusters of positive correlation between levels of microglial activation and tau aggregation in both the mild cognitive impairment (amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative) and Alzheimer's disease subjects. The correlations were stronger in Alzheimer's disease than in mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that these pathologies increase together as disease progresses. Levels of microglial activation and amyloid deposition were also correlated, although in a different spatial distribution; correlations were stronger in mild cognitive impairment than Alzheimer's subjects, in line with a plateauing of amyloid load with disease progression. Clusters of positive correlations between microglial activation and protein aggregation often targeted similar areas of association cortex, indicating that all three processes are present in specific vulnerable brain areas. For the first time using PET imaging, we show that microglial activation can correlate with both tau aggregation and amyloid deposition. This confirms the complex relationship between these processes. These results suggest that preventative treatment for Alzheimer's disease should target all three processes.},

abstract = {It has long been assumed that $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) had to assemble into fibrillar amyloid plaques to exert its neurotoxic effects in Alzheimer disease. An alternative hypothesis is that soluble oligomers ofA$\beta$ play a much larger role in neuronal damage than the insoluble component. We have tested these competing hypotheses in vivo by studying the clinicopathologic correlates of oligomeric A$\beta$ species and classic fibrillar amyloid plaques in the brains of double-transgenic APP-tau mice up to 17 months of age. Biochemical and immunohistochemical measures of brain oligomeric A$\beta$ exponentially increased with age. Oligomeric A$\beta$ load correlated with morphological markers of fibrillar A$\beta$ deposition. In contrast to total amyloid plaque burden, the amount of oligomeric A$\beta$ deposits labeled by the conformational epitope-specific antibody Nab61 closely correlated with neuronal loss and numbers of astrocytes in the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 hippocampal subfield. However, like other morphological A$\beta$ measurements, brain oligomeric A$\beta$ burden did not correlate well with memory deficits in these mice. The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in entorhinal cortex and CA1 most tightly correlated with memory impairment and neuronal cell loss. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the astrocyte response, which is likely triggered by brain oligomeric A$\beta$ accumulation, adversely affects cognition and might also contribute to neuronal cell death in this model.},

MRI scans of 37 patients with AD and 37 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, as well as 12 patients with FTD and 12 age-matched cognitively normal elderly individuals, were analyzed using voxel-based analysis and high-dimensional pattern classification. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of spatial patterns of regional brain atrophy found to be characteristic of AD and FTD were determined via cross-validation and via split-sample methods. Complex spatial patterns of relatively reduced brain volumes were identified, including temporal, orbitofrontal, parietal and cingulate regions, which were predominantly characteristic of either AD or FTD. These patterns provided 100% diagnostic accuracy, when used to separate AD or FTD from healthy controls. The ability to correctly distinguish AD from FTD averaged 84.3%. All estimates of diagnostic accuracy were determined via cross-validation. In conclusion, AD- and FTD-specific patterns of brain atrophy can be detected with high accuracy using high-dimensional pattern classification of MRI scans obtained in a typical clinical setting.},

The SPARE-AD score, summarizing brain atrophy patterns, was tested as a predictor of short-term conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI individuals that converted to AD (MCI-C) had mostly positive baseline SPARE-AD (Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD) and atrophy in temporal lobe gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), posterior cingulate/precuneous, and insula. MCI individuals that converted to AD had mostly AD-like baseline CSF biomarkers. MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC) had mixed baseline SPARE-AD and CSF values, suggesting that some MCI-NC subjects may later convert. Those MCI-NC with most negative baseline SPARE-AD scores (normal brain structure) had significantly higher baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (28.67) than others, and relatively low annual rate of Mini Mental State Examination decrease (-0.25). MCI-NC with midlevel baseline SPARE-AD displayed faster annual rates of SPARE-AD increase (indicating progressing atrophy). SPARE-AD and CSF combination improved prediction over individual values. In summary, both SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers showed high baseline sensitivity, however, many MCI-NC had abnormal baseline SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers. Longer follow-up will elucidate the specificity of baseline measurements.},

abstract = {A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.},

abstract = {Sparse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting computes the factorization PAQ = LU of a sparse matrix A , where the row ordering P is selected during factorization using standard partial pivoting with row interchanges. The goal is to select a column preordering, Q , based solely on the nonzero pattern of A , that limits the worst-case number of nonzeros in the factorization. The fill-in also depends on P , but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P . The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U . One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of A T A . A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of A T A to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since A T A may be much denser than A . An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A ; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. COLAMD is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.},

However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Brain connectivity studies have revealed that highly connected 'hub' regions are particularly vulnerable to Alzheimer pathology: they show marked amyloid-$\beta$ deposition at an early stage. Recently, excessive local neuronal activity has been shown to increase amyloid deposition. In this study we use a computational model to test the hypothesis that hub regions possess the highest level of activity and that hub vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease is due to this feature. Cortical brain regions were modeled as neural masses, each describing the average activity (spike density and spectral power) of a large number of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The large-scale network consisted of 78 neural masses, connected according to a human DTI-based cortical topology. Spike density and spectral power were positively correlated with structural and functional node degrees, confirming the high activity of hub regions, also offering a possible explanation for high resting state Default Mode Network activity. 'Activity dependent degeneration' (ADD) was simulated by lowering synaptic strength as a function of the spike density of the main excitatory neurons, and compared to random degeneration. Resulting structural and functional network changes were assessed with graph theoretical analysis. Effects of ADD included oscillatory slowing, loss of spectral power and long-range synchronization, hub vulnerability, and disrupted functional network topology. Observed transient increases in spike density and functional connectivity match reports in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, and may not be compensatory but pathological. In conclusion, the assumption of excessive neuronal activity leading to degeneration provides a possible explanation for hub vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, supported by the observed relation between connectivity and activity and the reproduction of several neurophysiologic hallmarks. The insight that neuronal activity might play a causal role in Alzheimer's disease can have implications for early detection and interventional strategies.},

The lesions of Alzheimer's disease: amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits, tau pathology and cellular oxidative damage, affect the hippocampus in the earlier stages causing memory impairment. In a 2-year longitudinal study of MCI patients and normal controls, we examined the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for these pathological features improve the diagnostic accuracy over memory and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-hippocampal volume evaluations. Relative to control, MCI patients showed decreased memory and hippocampal volumes and elevated CSF levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and isoprostane. These two CSF measures consistently improved the diagnostic accuracy over the memory measures and the isoprostane measure incremented the accuracy of the hippocampal volume achieving overall diagnostic accuracies of about 90%. Among MCI patients, over 2 years, longitudinal hippocampal volume losses were closely associated with increasing hyperphosphorylated tau and decreasing amyloid beta-42 levels. These results demonstrate that CSF biomarkers for AD contribute to the characterization of MCI.},

abstract = {Importance: Clinical subtyping of Parkinson disease at diagnosis is useful in estimating disease course and survival. Severity and rate of progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of clinical Parkinson subtypes. Objective: To provide longitudinal clinical disease-course data and neuropathologic correlation for newly proposed Parkinson disease subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with autopsy-confirmed Parkinson disease who were regularly seen throughout their disease course by hospital specialists in the United Kingdom and donated their brain at death to the Queen Square Brain Bank between January 2009 and December 2017. Patients with additional neuropathologic diagnoses, monogenic forms of parkinsonism, or insufficiently detailed clinical information were excluded. Based on severity of motor symptoms, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and autonomic and cognitive function at diagnosis, patients were classified adapting a subtyping classification into mild-motor predominant, intermediate, or diffuse malignant subtypes. Main Outcomes and Measures: Time from diagnosis to disease milestones (recurrent falls, wheelchair dependence, dementia, and care home placement) and death were compared between subtypes, and their risk was estimated using Cox hazard regression models. Severity and distribution of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease-related pathology were assessed using staging systems. Results: From a total of 146 patients, 111 patients were included (67 men [60.4%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 62.5 [11.5] years). The diffuse malignant subtype had earlier development of milestones and reduced survival. Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased adjusted risk of any disease milestone (hazard ratio, 10.90; 95% CI, 5.51-21.58; P <.001) and death (hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% CI, 1.98-6.75; P <.001) in the diffuse malignant group. Age at diagnosis was the only additional variable with statistical significance (adjusted hazard ratio for death, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17; P <.001). Staging of Lewy pathology and Alzheimer disease-related pathology did not differ between subtypes, although they showed different rates of progression, and the latter was associated with age at death. Conclusions and Relevance: Parkinson clinical subtypes at diagnosis may estimate disease course and survival, which may be useful in providing a more accurate prognosis in individual patients in clinical practice and helping to stratify subgroups in clinical trials. Different severity and progression of neuropathologies are important determinants of Parkinson subtypes, and age at diagnosis should be included in future subtype classifications.},

abstract = {We used MRI volume sampling with coregistered and atrophy corrected FDG-PET scans to test three hypotheses: 1) hippocampal formation measures are superior to temporal neocortical measures in the discrimination of normal (NL) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) neocortical measures are most useful in the separation of Alzheimer disease (AD) from NL or MCI; 3) measures of PET glucose metabolism (MRglu) have greater diagnostic sensitivity than MRI volume. Three groups of age, education, and gender matched NL, MCI, and AD subjects were studied. The results supported the hypotheses: 1) entorhinal cortex MRglu and hippocampal volume were most accurate in classifying NL and MCI; 2) both imaging modalities identified the temporal neocortex as best separating MCI and AD, whereas widespread changes accurately classified NL and AD; 3) In most between group comparisons regional MRglu measures were diagnostically superior to volume measures. These cross-sectional data show that in MCI hippocampal formation changes exist without significant neocortical changes. Neocortical changes best characterize AD. In both MCI and AD, metabolism reductions exceed volume losses.},

abstract = {The $\beta$-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. APP is processed in neurons, but little is known about the relative contributions of presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments to the release of A$\beta$ peptides. To address this issue, we transduced primary neurons from Sprague-Dawley rats or APP(-/-) mice (B6.129S7-App(tm1Dbo)/J) with lentiviral constructs expressing APP chimeras harboring targeting motifs from low-density lipoprotein receptor or neuron-glia cell-adhesion molecule to polarize expression to either dendritic or axonal membranes, respectively. Using imaging and quantitative biochemical approaches, we now report that APP selectively targeted to either axons or dendrites leads to the secretion of full-length A$\beta$ peptides with significantly elevated release from dendritic compartments. These findings reveal that the enzymatic machinery required for production of A$\beta$ peptides are operative both in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of primary neurons, leading to the suggestion that A$\beta$-mediated impairments in glutamatergic neurotransmission is the result of A$\beta$ release from both local and distal neuronal compartments.},

abstract = {In this autopsy-based study, $\alpha$-synuclein immunohistochemistry and lipofuscin pigment-Nissl architectonics in serial sections of 100 $\mu$m thickness were used to investigate the spinal cords and brains of 46 individuals: 28 patients with clinically and neuropathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease, 6 cases with incidental Lewy body disease, and 12 age-matched controls. $\alpha$-Synuclein inclusions (particulate aggregations, Lewy neurites/bodies) in the spinal cord were present between neuropathological stages 2-6 in all cases whose brains were staged for Parkinson's disease-related synucleinopathy. The only individuals who did not have Lewy pathology in the spinal cord were a single stage 1 case (incidental Lewy body disease) and all controls. Because the Parkinson's disease-related lesions were observable in the spinal cord only after Lewy pathology was seen in the brain, it could be concluded that, within the central nervous system, sporadic Parkinson's disease does not begin in the spinal cord. In addition: (1) $\alpha$-Synuclein-immunoreactive axons clearly predominated over Lewy bodies throughout the spinal cord and were visible in medial and anterior portions of the anterolateral funiculus. Their terminal axons formed dense $\alpha$-synuclein-immunoreactive networks in the gray matter and were most conspicuous in the lateral portions of layers 1, 7, and in the cellular islands of layer 9. (2) Notably, this axonopathy increased remarkably in density from cervicothoracic segments to lumbosacral segments of the cord. (3) Topographically, it is likely that the spinal cord $\alpha$-synuclein immunoreactive axonal networks represent descending projections from the supraspinal level setting nuclei (locus coeruleus, lower raphe nuclei, magnocellular portions of the reticular formation). (4) Following the appearance of the spinal cord axonal networks, select types of projection neurons in the spinal cord gray matter displayed $\alpha$-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions: chiefly, nociceptive neurons of the dorsal horn in layer 1, sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in layer 7, the cellular pools of $\alpha$-motoneurons in layer 9, and the smaller motoneurons in Onuf's nucleus in layer 9 (ventral horn). The spinal cord lesions may contribute to clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, constipation, poor balance, lower urinary tract complaints, and sexual dysfunction) that occur during the premotor and motor phases of sporadic Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the spatiotemporal mapping of tau pathologies and insoluble pools of Abeta in aging and sporadic AD, and their contribution to the physiopathologic, clinical, and neuropathologic features. METHODS: The authors studied 130 patients of various ages and different cognitive status, from nondemented controls (n = 60) to patients with severe definite AD (n = 70) who were followed prospectively. Insoluble Abeta 42 and 40 species were fully solubilized and quantified in the main neocortical areas, with a new procedure adapted to human brain tissue. Tau pathology staging was determined in 10 different brain areas, using Western blots. RESULTS: In AD, there is a constellation of amyloid phenotypes, extending from cases with exclusively aggregated Abeta 42 to cases with, in addition, large quantities of insoluble Abeta 40 species. Five other points were observed: 1) There was no spatial and temporal overlap in the distribution of these two insoluble Abeta species in cortical brain areas. 2) In contrast to solubilized Abeta 40 aggregates composed essentially of monomers and dimers, solubilized Abeta 42 was essentially observed as dimers and multimers. 3) Abeta 42 aggregates were observed at the early stages of tau pathology, whereas the insoluble Abeta 40 pool was found at the last stages. 4) During the progression of the disease, Abeta aggregates increase in quantity and heterogeneity, in close parallel to the extension of tau pathology. 5) There was no spatial overlap between Abeta aggregation that is widespread and heterogeneously distributed in cortical areas and tau pathology that is progressing sequentially, stereotypically, and hierarchically. CONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that Abeta 42 aggregation, and not Abeta 40, is the marker that is close to Alzheimer etiology. It should be the main target for the early biological diagnosis of AD and modeling. Furthermore, the spatial mismatch between amyloid ss-precursor protein (APP) and tau pathologies in cortical brain areas demonstrates that neurodegeneration is not a direct consequence of extracellular Abeta neurotoxicity. Hence, there is a synergetic effect of APP dysfunction, revealed by Abeta aggregation, on the neuron-to-neuron propagation of tau pathology.},

@article{Deleglise2014,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent histopathological studies have shown that neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease develop along neuronal networks and that hallmarks could propagate trans-synaptically through neuronal pathways. The underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, and investigations have been impeded by the complexity of brain connectivity and the need for experimental models allowing a fine manipulation of the local microenvironment at the subcellular level. RESULTS: In this study, we have grown primary cortical mouse neurons in microfluidic ($\mu$FD) devices to separate soma from axonal projections in fluidically isolated microenvironments, and applied $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptides locally to the different cellular compartments. We observed that A$\beta$ application to the somato-dendritic compartment triggers a "dying-back" process, involving caspase and NAD+ signalling pathways, whereas exposure of the axonal/distal compartment to A$\beta$ deposits did not induce axonal degeneration. In contrast, co-treatment with somatic sub-toxic glutamate and axonal A$\beta$ peptide triggered axonal degeneration. To study the consequences of such subcellular/local A$\beta$ stress at the network level we developed new $\mu$FD multi-chamber devices containing funnel-shaped micro-channels which force unidirectional axon growth and used them to recreate in vitro an oriented cortico-hippocampal pathway. A$\beta$ application to the cortical somato-dendritic chamber leads to a rapid cortical pre-synaptic loss. This happens concomitantly with a post-synaptic hippocampal tau-phosphorylation which could be prevented by the NMDA-receptor antagonist, MK-801, before any sign of axonal and somato-dendritic cortical alteration. CONCLUSION: Thanks to $\mu$FD-based reconstructed neuronal networks we evaluated the distant effects of local A$\beta$ stress on neuronal subcompartments and networks. Our data indicates that distant neurotransmission modifications actively take part in the early steps of the abnormal mechanisms leading to pathology progression independently of local A$\beta$ production. This offers new tools to decipher mechanisms underlying Braak's staging. Our data suggests that local A$\beta$ can play a role in remote tauopathy by distant disturbance of neurotransmission, providing a putative mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal appearance of pretangles.},

Further research and clinical experience have resulted in new insights and perspectives on the details of the circuitry and on the role of these structures in Parkinson disease and other basal ganglia disorders.

abstract = {The primary feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into characteristic lesions: Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites. However, in most of DLB cases, LBs are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques (both Alzheimer disease [AD]-related lesions). We wanted to determine if this overlap of lesions is statistical, as a result of the late onset of both diseases, or results from a specific physiopathological synergy between synucleinopathy and either tauopathy or amyloid pathology. All patients with DLB from our prospective and multidisciplinary study were analyzed. These cases were compared with cases with pure AD and patients with Parkinson disease and controls. All cases were analyzed thoroughly at the neuropathologic and biochemical levels with a biochemical staging of aggregated alpha-synuclein, tau, and Abeta species. All sporadic cases of DLB were associated with abundant deposits of Abeta x-42 that were similar in quality and quantity to those of AD. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) dysfunction is a risk factor for AD as demonstrated by pathogenic mutations and Abeta accumulation. The constant and abundant Abeta x-42 deposition in sporadic DLB suggests that synucleinopathy is also promoted by APP dysfunction. Therefore, we conclude that APP is a therapeutic target for both AD and DLB.},

abstract = {We propose a regularized, fast, and robust analytical solution for the Q-ball imaging (QBI) reconstruction of the orientation distribution function (ODF) together with its detailed validation and a discussion on its benefits over the state-of-the-art. Our analytical solution is achieved by modeling the raw high angular resolution diffusion imaging signal with a spherical harmonic basis that incorporates a regularization term based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on the unit sphere. This leads to an elegant mathematical simplification of the Funk-Radon transform which approximates the ODF. We prove a new corollary of the Funk-Hecke theorem to obtain this simplification. Then, we show that the Laplace-Beltrami regularization is theoretically and practically better than Tikhonov regularization. At the cost of slightly reducing angular resolution, the Laplace-Beltrami regularization reduces ODF estimation errors and improves fiber detection while reducing angular error in the ODF maxima detected. Finally, a careful quantitative validation is performed against ground truth from synthetic data and against real data from a biological phantom and a human brain dataset. We show that our technique is also able to recover known fiber crossings in the human brain and provides the practical advantage of being up to 15 times faster than original numerical QBI method.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its transitional state mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are characterized by amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposition within the cerebral neocortex and neuronal loss within the hippocampal formation. However, the precise relationship between pathologic changes in neocortical regions and hippocampal atrophy is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, combining structural MRI scans and automated image analysis tools with reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A$\beta$ levels, a surrogate for intra-cranial amyloid plaques and elevated CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels, a surrogate for neocortical NFTs, we examined the relationship between the presence of Alzheimer's pathology, gray matter thickness of select neocortical regions, and hippocampal volume in cognitively normal older participants and individuals with MCI and AD (n = 724). Amongst all 3 groups, only select heteromodal cortical regions significantly correlated with hippocampal volume. Amongst MCI and AD individuals, gray matter thickness of the entorhinal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus significantly predicted longitudinal hippocampal volume loss in both amyloid positive and p-tau positive individuals. Amongst cognitively normal older adults, thinning only within the medial portion of the orbital frontal cortex significantly differentiated amyloid positive from amyloid negative individuals whereas thinning only within the entorhinal cortex significantly discriminated p-tau positive from p-tau negative individuals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Cortical A$\beta$ and tau pathology affects gray matter thinning within select neocortical regions and potentially contributes to downstream hippocampal degeneration. Neocortical Alzheimer's pathology is evident even amongst older asymptomatic individuals suggesting the existence of a preclinical phase of dementia.},

abstract = {Neuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein and Lewy body formation are characteristic to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). This Lewy pathology appears to spread throughout the brain as the disease progresses. Furthermore, recent studies showed the occurrence of Lewy pathology in neurons grafted into the brains of PD patients, suggesting the spread of pathology from the host tissues to the grafts. The mechanism underlying this propagation is unknown. Here, we show that alpha-synuclein is transmitted via endocytosis to neighboring neurons and neuronal precursor cells, forming Lewy-like inclusions. Moreover, alpha-synuclein was transmitted from the affected neurons to engrafted neuronal precursor cells in a transgenic model of PD-like pathology. Failure of the protein quality control systems, especially lysosomes, promoted the accumulation of transmitted alpha-synuclein and inclusion formation. Cells exposed to neuron-derived alpha-synuclein showed signs of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and caspase 3 activation, both in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate the cell-to-cell transmission of alpha-synuclein aggregates and provide critical insights into the mechanism of pathological progression in PD and other proteinopathies.},

abstract = {Disintegrin metalloproteases of the ADAM family form a large (at present > 40 members in mammals) family of multidomain membrane proteins that in their ectodomain combine a cystein-rich, disintegrin and a zinc metalloprotease domain. Via their metalloprotease domain, ADAMs are often implicated in ectodomain shedding, either to release e.g. growth factors or to initiate further intracellular signalling via regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Mainly based upon overexpression studies in vehicle cells, three of them, ADAMs 9, 10 and 17, have been proposed to act as alpha-secretases for amyloid precursor protein (APP). It is striking thereby that this role has since then remained somewhat ill-defined, as APP processing in ADAM9 deficient neurons is unaltered, and also ADAM10 deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts exhibit at best a highly variable reduction in alpha-secretase activity. However, during the past years, numerous other substrates have been linked to all three sheddases, the cleavage of which in some cases appears to be strikingly more important for the organism than APP processing. Most notably, the perinatally lethal phenotype of ADAM17 knockout mice is dominated by a loss of growth factor shedding, while the even earlier fatal effects of ADAM10 deficiency exhibit key features of disabled Notch signalling and possibly also cadherin processing defects. In this review, we will summarize the published data on the "non-APP" functions of all three ADAMs, the further evaluation of which may be crucial when attempting to treat Alzheimer s Disease by increasing their expression and/or activity. As the knockouts of ADAM10 and ADAM17 are only informative for their roles in (early) development, while a number of recently assigned new substrates play crucial roles in the normal and/or diseased adult organism as well, work on conditional knockout models will be crucial to fully characterize both the full functional portfolio of (candidate) alpha-secretases as well as their clinical relevance, which may go way beyond Alzheimer s Disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To estimate the incidence of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) in older Italians and evaluate the relationship of age, gender, and education to developing dementia. DESIGN Cohort incidence study in the context of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging. SETTING Population sample from eight Italian municipalities. PARTICIPANTS A dementia-free cohort of 3,208 individuals (aged 65-84), individuated after a baseline evaluation performed in 1992 / 93, aimed at detecting prevalent cases. MEASUREMENTS The dementia-free cohort was reexamined in 1995 to identify incident cases. The Mini-Mental State Examination (cutoff 23 / 24) was employed to screen for dementia. Trained neurologists evaluated the individuals who screened positive. Final diagnoses had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised criteria for dementia, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision criteria for VaD. RESULTS Before the follow-up examination, 382 individuals had died (232 had reliable information). Of the 2,826 survivors, 2,266 completed the study. Overall, 127 new dementia cases were identified. Average incidence rates per 1,000 person-years were 12.47 (95% confidence interval (CI)=10.23-14.72) for dementia, 6.55 (95% CI=4.92-8.17) for AD, and 3.30 (95% CI=2.14-4.45) for VaD. Both AD and VaD showed age-dependent patterns. Education was protective against dementia and AD. Women carried a significantly higher risk of developing AD (hazard ratio=1.67, 95% CI=1.02-2.75), and men of developing VaD (hazard ratio=2.23, 95% CI=1.06-4.71). CONCLUSIONS Incidence of dementia in Italy paralleled that in most industrialized countries. About 150,000 new cases per year are expected. A significant gender effect was evidenced for major dementia subtypes. The burden of VaD, especially in men, offers opportunities for prevention.},

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies that bind target autoantigens in multiple organs in the body. In peripheral organs, immune complexes engage the complement cascade, recruiting blood-borne inflammatory cells and initiating tissue inflammation. Immune complex-mediated activation of Fc receptors on infiltrating blood-borne cells and tissue resident cells amplifies an inflammatory cascade with resulting damage to tissue function, ultimately leading to tissue destruction. This pathophysiology appears to explain tissue injury throughout the body, except in the central nervous system. This review addresses a paradigm we have developed for autoantibody-mediated brain damage. This paradigm suggests that antibody-mediated brain disease does not depend on immune complex formation but rather on antibody-mediated alterations in neuronal activation and survival. Moreover, antibodies only access brain tissue when blood-brain barrier integrity is impaired, leading to a lack of concurrence of brain disease and tissue injury in other organs. We discuss the implications of this model for lupus and for identifying other antibodies that may contribute to brain disease.},

abstract = {Markers of oxidative damage have been detected in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. These findings implicate oxidative injury in the neurodegenerative process, but whether oxidative stress is a cause or a consequence of neurotoxicity remains unclear. We used a Drosophila model of human tauopathies to investigate the role of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration. Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms significantly modified neurodegeneration in our model, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a causal role in neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that the JNK signaling pathway is activated in our model, which is in agreement with previous findings in AD tissue. Furthermore, we show that the extent of JNK activation correlates with the degree of tau-induced neurodegeneration. Finally, our findings suggest that oxidative stress acts not to promote tau phosphorylation, but to enhance tau-induced cell cycle activation. In summary, our study identifies oxidative stress as a causal factor in tau-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness measurement are common techniques to identify regional atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because studies employing these methods draw conclusions regarding patterns of regional cortical degeneration, it is important to be aware of their possible limitations. To evaluate the effect of different VBM versions, we performed voxel-based analyses through successive versions-from SPM99 to SPM8-as well as FSL-VBM on n = 20 AD patients and n = 20 controls. Reproducibility was assessed in an independent sample, again of n = 20 per group, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Further, we tested the hypothesis that VBM can sensitively detect hippocampal atrophy, but is relatively insensitive to changes in the cortical ribbon, by contrasting VBM with FreeSurfer cortical thickness measurements. The results with both datasets confirmed that VBM preferentially identifies grey matter lesions in the mesial temporal lobe but is largely insensitive to isocortical atrophy. In contrast, FreeSurfer identified thinning of cortical ribbon association cortex more significant in post- rather than pre-Rolandic areas and with relative preservation of primary sensory-motor regions-in other words precisely as would be expected in AD. The results highlight a bias that VBM has toward detecting mesial temporal lobe atrophy. This finding has important implications for interpretation of clinical and cognitive studies in AD.},

@article{Dickerson2013,
abstract = {Objective: New diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been developed using biomarkers aiming to establish whether the clinical syndrome is likely due to underlying AD. We investigated the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting progression from amnesic MCI to dementia, testing the hypotheses that (1) markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration provide distinct and complementary prognostic information over different time intervals, and that (2) evidence of neurodegeneration in amyloid-negative MCI individuals would be useful prognostically. Methods: Data were obtained from the ADNI-1 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1) database on all individuals with a baseline diagnosis of MCI, baseline MRI and CSF data, and at least one follow-up visit. MRI data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a measure known as the ``AD signature,'' as well as hippocampal volume. The CSF biomarkers amyloid-$\beta$, total tau, and phospho tau were also examined. We performed logistic regression analyses to identify the best baseline biomarker predictors of progression to dementia over 1 or 3 years, and Cox regression models to test the utility of these markers for predicting time-to-dementia. Results: For prediction of dementia in MCI, the AD signature cortical thickness biomarker performed better than hippocampal volume. Although CSF tau measures were better than CSF amyloid-$\beta$ at predicting dementia within 1 year, the AD signature was better than all CSF measures at prediction over this relatively short-term interval. CSF amyloid-$\beta$ was superior to tau and AD signature at predicting dementia over 3 years. When CSF amyloid-$\beta$ was dichotomized using previously published cutoff values and treated as a categorical variable, a multivariate stepwise Cox regression model indicated that both the AD signature MRI marker and the categorical CSF amyloid-$\beta$ marker were useful in predicting time-to-event diagnosis of AD dementia. Conclusion: In amnesic MCI, short-term (1 year) prognosis of progression to dementia relates strongly to baseline markers of neurodegeneration, with the AD signature MRI biomarker of cortical thickness performing the best among MRI and CSF markers studied here. Longer-term (3 year) prognosis in these individuals was better predicted by a marker indicative of brain amyloid. Prediction of time-to-event in a survival model was predicted by the combination of these biomarkers. These results provide further support for emerging models of the temporal relationship of pathophysiologic events in AD and demonstrate the utility of these biomarkers at the prodromal stage of the illness.},

Materials and Methods Prospective 18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain.

In neurons, microtubules are abundantly decorated with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as tau. Motor proteins thus encounter MAPs frequently along their path. To determine the effects of tau on dynein and kinesin motility, we conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau. Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of dynein and kinesin motility suggests that MAPs can spatially regulate the balance of microtubule-dependent axonal transport.},

abstract = {See Coulthard and Knight (doi:10.1093/aww335) for a scientific commentary on this article.Individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnoses can display significant phenotypic heterogeneity. This variability likely reflects underlying genetic, environmental and neuropathological differences. Characterizing this heterogeneity is important for precision diagnostics, personalized predictions, and recruitment of relatively homogeneous sets of patients into clinical trials. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging cohort (ADNI) to elucidate the heterogeneity of neuroanatomical differences between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 530) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 314) and cognitively normal individuals (n = 399), thereby adding to an increasing literature aiming to establish neuroanatomical and neuropathological (e.g. amyloid and tau deposition) dimensions in Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stages. These dimensional approaches aim to provide surrogate measures of heterogeneous underlying pathologic processes leading to cognitive impairment. We relate these neuroimaging patterns to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, white matter hyperintensities, cognitive and clinical measures, and longitudinal trajectories. We identified four such atrophy patterns: (i) individuals with largely normal neuroanatomical profiles, who also turned out to have the least abnormal cognitive and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles and the slowest clinical progression during follow-up; (ii) individuals with classical Alzheimer's disease neuroanatomical, cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and clinical profile, who presented the fastest clinical progression; (iii) individuals with a diffuse pattern of atrophy with relatively less pronounced involvement of the medial temporal lobe, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-$\beta$1-42 values, and proportionally greater executive impairment; and (iv) individuals with notably focal involvement of the medial temporal lobe and a slow steady progression, likely representing in early Alzheimer's disease stages. These four atrophy patterns effectively define a 4-dimensional categorization of neuroanatomical alterations in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease that can complement existing dimensional approaches for staging Alzheimer's disease using a variety of biomarkers, which offer the potential for enabling precision diagnostics and prognostics, as well as targeted patient recruitment of relatively homogeneous subgroups of subjects for clinical trials.},

Little is known, however, about the different phenotypes of microglia and how they change during disease progression, in the SN or in another brain region, like the hippocampus (HC), which is implicated in dementia and depression, important non-motor symptoms in PD. We studied phenotypes and activation of microglia in the SN and HC of established PD patients (Braak PD stage 4–6), matched controls (Braak PD stage 0) and of incidental Lewy Body disease (iLBD) cases (Braak PD stage 1–3) that are considered a prodromal state of PD. As recent experimental studies suggested that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mediates $\alpha$-synuclein triggered microglial activation, we also studied whether TLR2 expression is indeed related to pathology in iLBD and PD patients. A clear $\alpha$-synuclein pathology-related increase in amoeboid microglia was present in the HC and SN in PD. Also, morphologically primed/reactive microglial cells, and a profound increase in microglial TLR2 expression were apparent in iLBD, but not PD, cases, indicative of an early activational response to PD pathology. Moreover, TLR2 was differentially expressed between the SN and HC, consistent with a region-specific pattern of microglial activation. In conclusion, the regional changes in microglial phenotype and TLR2 expression in primed/reactive microglia in the SN and HC of iLBD cases indicate that TLR2 may play a prominent role in the microglial-mediated responses that could be important for PD progression.},

Here we report whole-brain findings from a comprehensive study of diffusion tensor indices and probabilistic tractography obtained in a very large population of healthy controls, MCI and probable AD subjects. As expected from the literature, all diffusion indices converged to show that the cingulum bundle, the uncinate fasciculus, the entire corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus are the most affected white matter tracts in AD. Significant differences between MCI and AD were essentially confined to the corpus callosum. More importantly, we introduce for the first time in a degenerative disorder an application of a recently developed tensor index, the "mode" of anisotropy, as well as probabilistic crossing-fibre tractography. The mode of anisotropy specifies the type of anisotropy as a continuous measure reflecting differences in shape of the diffusion tensor ranging from planar (e.g., in regions of crossing fibres from two fibre populations of similar density or regions of "kissing" fibres) to linear (e.g., in regions where one fibre population orientation predominates), while probabilistic crossing-fibre tractography allows to accurately trace pathways from a crossing-fibre region. Remarkably, when looking for whole-brain diffusion differences between MCI patients and healthy subjects, the only region with significant abnormalities was a region of crossing fibres in the centrum semiovale, showing an increased mode of anisotropy. The only white matter region demonstrating a significant difference in correlations between neuropsychological scores and a diffusion measure (mode of anisotropy) across the three groups was the same region of crossing fibres. Further examination using probabilistic tractography established explicitly and quantitatively that this previously unreported increase of mode and co-localised increase of fractional anisotropy was explained by a relative preservation of motor-related projection fibres (at this early stage of the disease) crossing the association fibres of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. These findings emphasise the benefit of looking at the more complex regions in which spared and affected pathways are crossing to detect very early alterations of the white matter that could not be detected in regions consisting of one fibre population only. Finally, the methods used in this study may have general applicability for other degenerative disorders and, beyond the clinical sphere, they could contribute to a better quantification and understanding of subtle effects generated by normal processes such as visuospatial attention or motor learning.},

abstract = {Dementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are no rare causes of dementia. Both have neuropathologically, clinically, and neurochemically much in common. In the course of both conditions frequently psychotic symptoms occur, often induced by antiparkinsonian medication. Treatment of psychotic features with conventional antipsychotics is not tolerated in many cases. Therefore low-dose clozapine treatment is acknowledged usual practise for psychosis in Parkinson's disease and a case report indicates efficacy for psychosis in DLB, too. All other atypical antipsychotics except risperidone are not licensed for dementia in Germany, but risperidone is contraindicated in DLB due to manufacturer's notice and usually not well tolerated in DLB and Parkinson's disease. Open trials indicate safety for treatment of psychosis in DLB and PDD with quetiapine. Randomized controlled trials indicate, that quetiapine is less effective than clozapine against psychotic symptoms in both conditions, although comparatively safe. Cholinesterase inhibitors, especially rivastigmine, are a therapeutic alternative for treating both psychotic and cognitive symptoms in both conditions. Parkinsonism in DLB-patients responds worse to levodopa compared to patient with Parkinson's disease. Anticholinergic drugs often induce delirium in demented patients and therefore should be avoided. The same problem is associated with dopamine agonists in PDD and DLB. Amantadine, a NMDA-receptor antagonist like memantine, potentially bears the same risk of worsening psychotic symptoms. The following preliminary recommendation for drug treatment of PDD and DLB can be given: Stop all anticholinergic medication and reduce levodopa and other antiparkinsonian medication to the tolerated minimum. Levodopa alone is preferred. Treat with cholinesterase inhibitors to the maximum tolerated dose. If there is no adequate response regarding psychotic symptoms, add quetiapine. If this approach fails, replace quetiapine by low-dose clozapine. If behavioural disturbances are due to depression, anxiety, or irritability, treatment with an antidepressant, preferably citalopram, is an option.},

abstract = {Older persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) feature neurobiological Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in 50% to 70% of the cases and develop dementia within the next 5 to 7 years. Current evidence suggests that biochemical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neuropsychological markers can track the disease over time since the MCI stage (also called prodromal AD). The amount of evidence supporting their validity is of variable strength. We have reviewed the current literature and categorized evidence of validity into three classes: Class A, availability of multiple serial studies; Class B a single serial study or multiple cross sectional studies of patients with increasing disease severity from MCI to probable AD; and class C, multiple cross sectional studies of patients in the dementia stage, not including the MCI stage. Several Class A studies suggest that episodic memory and semantic fluency are the most reliable neuropsychological markers of progression. Hippocampal atrophy, ventricular volume and whole brain atrophy are structural MRI markers with class A evidence. Resting-state fMRI and connectivity, and diffusion MR markers in the medial temporal white matter (parahippocampus and posterior cingulum) and hippocampus are promising but require further validation. Change in amyloid load in MCI patients warrant further investigations, e.g. over longer period of time, to assess its value as marker of disease progression. Several spectral markers of resting state EEG rhythms that might reflect neurodegenerative processes in the prodromal stage of AD (EEG power density, functional coupling, spectral coherence, and synchronization) suffer from lack of appropriately designed studies. Although serial studies on late event-related potentials (ERPs) in healthy elders or MCI patients are inconclusive, others tracking disease progression and effects of cholinesterase inhibiting drugs in AD, and cross-sectional including MCI or predicting development of AD offer preliminary evidence of validity as a marker of disease progression from the MCI stage. CSF Markers, such as A$\beta$ 1-42, t-tau and p-tau are valuable markers which support the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, these markers are not sensitive to disease progression and cannot be used to monitor the severity of Alzheimer's disease. For Isoprostane F2 some evidence exists that its increase correlates with the progression and the severity of AD.},

abstract = {Disruption of functional connectivity between brain regions may represent an early functional consequence of $\beta$-amyloid pathology prior to clinical Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate if non-demented older individuals with increased amyloid burden demonstrate disruptions of functional whole-brain connectivity in cortical hubs (brain regions typically highly connected to multiple other brain areas) and if these disruptions are associated with neuronal dysfunction as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. In healthy subjects without cognitive symptoms and patients with mild cognitive impairment, we used positron emission tomography to assess amyloid burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, structural magnetic resonance imaging to quantify atrophy and novel resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging processing methods to calculate whole-brain connectivity. Significant disruptions of whole-brain connectivity were found in amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment in typical cortical hubs (posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus), strongly overlapping with regional hypometabolism. Subtle connectivity disruptions and hypometabolism were already present in amyloid-positive asymptomatic subjects. Voxel-based morphometry measures indicate that these findings were not solely a consequence of regional atrophy. Whole-brain connectivity values and metabolism showed a positive correlation with each other and a negative correlation with amyloid burden. These results indicate that disruption of functional connectivity and hypometabolism may represent early functional consequences of emerging molecular Alzheimer's disease pathology, evolving prior to clinical onset of dementia. The spatial overlap between hypometabolism and disruption of connectivity in cortical hubs points to a particular susceptibility of these regions to early Alzheimer's-type neurodegeneration and may reflect a link between synaptic dysfunction and functional disconnection.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be difficult to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Distinguishing the two dementias based on volumetric measurements of brain atrophy with MRI has been only partially successful. Whether MRI measurements of cortical thinning improve the differentiation between Alzheimer's disease and FTD is unclear. In this study, we measured cortical thickness using a set of automated tools (Freesurfer) to reconstruct the brain's cortical surface from T1-weighted structural MRI data in 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 19 patients with FTD and 23 cognitively normal subjects. The goals were to detect the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in these two types of dementia, to test the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive impairment, to determine if measurement of cortical thickness is better than that of cortical volume for differentiating between these dementias and normal ageing and improving the classification of Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone. Compared to cognitively normal subjects, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner cortex primarily in bilateral, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes (P < 0.001), while FTD patients had a thinner cortex in bilateral, frontal and temporal regions and some thinning in inferior parietal regions and the posterior cingulate (P < 0.001). Compared to FTD patients, Alzheimer's disease patients had a thinner cortex (P < 0.001) in parts of bilateral parietal and precuneus regions. Cognitive impairment was negatively correlated with cortical thickness of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes in Alzheimer's disease, while similar correlations were not significant in FTD. Measurement of cortical thickness was similar to that of cortical volume in differentiating between normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and FTD. Furthermore, cortical thickness measurements significantly improved the classification between Alzheimer's disease and FTD based on neuropsychological scores alone, including the Mini-Mental State Examination and a modified version of the Trail-Making Test. In conclusion, the characteristic patterns of cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease and FTD suggest that cortical thickness may be a useful surrogate marker for these types of dementia.},

The present study investigates the nature of white matter damage of patients with Alzheimer's disease with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and analyses the relationship between the white matter damage and the cognition function. DTI, as well as T1 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-FLAIR, was performed on probable patients of Alzheimer's disease, and sex and age matched healthy volunteers to measure the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, and the white matter of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. FA was lower in the splenium of corpus callosum, as well as in the white matter of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in the corresponding region from healthy controls and was strongly positive correlated with MMSE scores, whereas FA appeared no different in the anterior and posterior limbs of internal capsule, occipital lobes white matter, and the genu of corpus callosum between the patients and healthy controls. MD was significantly higher in the splenium of corpus callosum and parietal lobes white matter from patients than in that those from healthy controls and was strongly negative correlated with MMSE scores, whereas MD in the anterior and posterior limbs of internal capsule, as well as in frontal, temporal, occipital lobes white matter and the genu of corpus callosum, was not different between the patients and healthy controls. The most prominent alteration of FA and MD was in the splenium of corpus callosum. Our results suggested that white matter of patients with Alzheimer's disease was selectively impaired and the extent of damage had a strong correlation with the cognitive function, and that selective impairment reflected the cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical disconnections in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease. The values of FA and MD in white matter, especially in the splenium of corpus callosum in AD patients, might be a more appropriate surrogate marker for monitoring the disease progression.},

The spread of tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) across the cerebral cortex parallels symptom severity2,3. We hypothesized that the kinetics of tau spread may vary if the properties of the propagating tau proteins vary across individuals. We carried out biochemical, biophysical, MS and both cell- and animal-based-bioactivity assays to characterize tau in 32 patients with AD. We found striking patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the hyperphosphorylated species of soluble, oligomeric, seed-competent tau. Tau seeding activity correlates with the aggressiveness of the clinical disease, and some post-translational modification (PTM) sites appear to be associated with both enhanced seeding activity and worse clinical outcomes, whereas others are not. These data suggest that different individuals with ‘typical' AD may have distinct biochemical features of tau. These data are consistent with the possibility that individuals with AD, much like people with cancer, may have multiple molecular drivers of an otherwise common phenotype, and emphasize the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches for slowing clinical progression of AD.},

In the human brain, the hierarchical pathways of this neurodegeneration have been well established in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other sporadic tauopathies such as argyrophilic grain disorder and progressive supranuclear palsy but the molecular and cellular mechanisms supporting this progression are yet not known. These pathways appear to be associated with the intercellular transmission of pathology, as recently suggested in Tau transgenic mice. However, these conclusions remain ill-defined due to a lack of toxicity data and difficulties associated with the use of mutant Tau.$\$n$\$nRESULTS: Using a lentiviral-mediated rat model of hippocampal NFD, we demonstrated that wild-type human Tau protein is axonally transferred from ventral hippocampus neurons to connected secondary neurons even at distant brain areas such as olfactory and limbic systems indicating a trans-synaptic protein transfer. Using different immunological tools to follow phospho-Tau species, it was clear that Tau pathology generated using mutated Tau remains near the IS whereas it spreads much further using the wild-type one.$\$n$\$nCONCLUSION: Taken together, these results support a novel mechanism for Tau protein transfer compared to previous reports based on transgenic models with mutant cDNA. It also demonstrates that mutant Tau proteins are not suitable for the development of experimental models helpful to validate therapeutic intervention interfering with Tau spreading.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Various biomarkers have been reported in recent literature regarding imaging abnormalities in different types of dementia. These biomarkers have helped to significantly improve early detection and also differentiation of various dementia syndromes. In this study, we systematically applied whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) based support vector machine classification separately and on combined information from different imaging modalities to improve the detection and differentiation of different types of dementia. METHODS: Patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD: n = 21), with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD: n = 14) and control subjects (n = 13) underwent both [F18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with clinical and behavioral assessment. FDG-PET and MRI data were commonly processed to get a precise overlap of all regions in both modalities. Support vector machine classification was applied with varying parameters separately for both modalities and to combined information obtained from MR and FDG-PET images. ROIs were extracted from comprehensive systematic and quantitative meta-analyses investigating both disorders. RESULTS: Using single-modality whole-brain and ROI information FDG-PET provided highest accuracy rates for both, detection and differentiation of AD and FTLD compared to structural information from MRI. The ROI-based multimodal classification, combining FDG-PET and MRI information, was highly superior to the unimodal approach and to the whole-brain pattern classification. With this method, accuracy rate of up to 92% for the differentiation of the three groups and an accuracy of 94% for the differentiation of AD and FTLD patients was obtained. CONCLUSION: Accuracy rate obtained using combined information from both imaging modalities is the highest reported up to now for differentiation of both types of dementia. Our results indicate a substantial gain in accuracy using combined FDG-PET and MRI information and suggest the incorporation of such approaches to clinical diagnosis and to differential diagnostic procedures of neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to investigate the cortical and white matter changes that underlie cognitive impairment in patients with incident Parkinson's disease (PD) disease using voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Newly diagnosed nondemented PD (n = 125) and control subjects (n = 50) were recruited from the Incidence of Cognitive Impairment in Cohorts with Longitudinal Evaluation in Parkinson's Disease Study and completed cognitive assessments and 3T structural and diffusion tensor MR imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to investigate the relationship between gray matter volume and cognitive ability. Microstructural white matter changes were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging measures of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity using tract-based spatial statistics. RESULTS: Increased mean diffusivity was observed bilaterally in subjects with PD, relative to controls (P = 0.019). Increased mean diffusivity was associated with performance on the semantic fluency and Tower of London tasks in frontal and parietal white matter tracts, including the cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. There was no difference in total gray matter volume between groups; however, bilateral reductions in frontal and parietal gray matter volume were associated with reduced performance on measures of executive function in PD subjects. CONCLUSIONS: At the earliest stages of PD, regionally specific increases in central white matter mean diffusivity are present and suggest early axonal damage. Such changes are not accompanied by significant gray matter volume loss and are consistent with proposed models of pathological progression of the disease. Structural MRI, especially diffusion tensor imaging analysis, offers potential as a noninvasive biomarker reflecting cognitive impairment in PD. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, yet despite this, very little is known about the underlying cellular mechanisms. Initially it was thought to be a disease primarily involving loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Recent studies, however, have focused on observations that aggregated $\alpha$-synuclein protein, the major component of Lewy bodies, is found throughout the nervous system. It is speculated that misfolded $\alpha$-synuclein transfers between cells in a prion-like manner, thereby mediating the spread of the neuropathology. In this review, we discuss the staging (according to Braak) of Parkinson pathology and the concept describing the disease progression from one region of the brain to the other. We highlight how $\alpha$-synuclein might be responsible for the spread of the disease. We compare the idea of a prion-like mechanism contributing to Parkinson's disease to emerging concepts that other proteins participate in similar processes in other neurodegenerative diseases. We then examine the future implications of a critical role in disease pathogenesis of $\alpha$-synuclein for the classification, diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease in the future.},

abstract = {In vivo exploration of activated microglia in neurodegenerative diseases is achievable by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, using dedicated radiopharmaceuticals targeting the translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO). In this review, we emphasized the major advances made over the last 20 years, thanks to TSPO PET imaging, to define the pathophysiological implication of microglia activation and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and also in psychiatric disorders. The extent and upregulation of TSPO as a molecular biomarker of activated microglia in the human brain is now widely documented in these pathologies, but its significance, and especially its protective or deleterious action regarding the disease's stage, remains under debate. Thus, we exposed new and plausible suggestions to enhance the contribution of TSPO PET imaging for biomedical research by exploring microglia's role and interactions with other cells in brain parenchyma. Multiplex approaches, associating TSPO PET radiopharmaceuticals with other biomarkers (PET imaging of cellular metabolism, neurotransmission or abnormal protein aggregates, but also other imaging modalities, and peripheral cytokine levels measurement and/or metabolomics analysis) was considered. Finally, the actual clinical impact of TSPO PET imaging as a routine biomarker of neuroinflammation was put into perspective regarding the current development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Accumulation of specific proteins has replaced loss of specific populations of neurons in the definition of most neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases, the amino-acid sequence of the protein that accumulates is altered by a mutation in the gene that codes for it but most generally, the primary structure is normal. Much evidence from human neuropathology has been collected over the years indicating that the progression of the lesions in such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy follow the neuroanatomical connections. More recently, injection of aggregates of the specific proteins in the brain of experimental animals has been attempted in various experimental settings. Brain homogenates containing A$\beta$ aggregates induce the early development of A$\beta$ deposits in APP transgenic mice. Brain homogenates from various human tauopathies induce tau aggregates in transgenic mice expressing normal human tau. Finally, synthetic preformed fibrils of alpha-synuclein initiate the development of alpha-synuclein accumulation resembling Parkinson's disease in wild-type mice. Experiments in cell cultures suggest that the protein has to be in some specific state of oligomerization or fibrillation to be endocytosed and transported by the neuron. These data suggest that the protein that accumulates in a specific disease is initially misfolded and that this misfolding contaminates normal protein in a prion-like manner - in some cases through the neuronal connections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical research into Parkinson's disease has focused increasingly on the development of interventions that slow the neurodegeneration underlying this disorder. These investigations have stimulated interest in finding objective biomarkers that show changes in the rate of disease progression with treatment. Through radiotracer-based imaging of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, a specific class of biomarkers to monitor the progression of Parkinson's disease has been identified, and these biomarkers were used in the clinical trials of drugs with the potential to modify the course of the disease. However, in some of these studies there was discordance between the imaging outcome measures and blinded clinical ratings of disease severity. Research is underway to identify and validate alternative ways to image brain metabolism, through which the efficacy of new therapies for Parkinson's disease and related disorders can be assessed. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: During recent years, spatial covariance analysis has been used with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET to detect abnormal patterns of brain metabolism in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Rapid, automated, voxel-based algorithms have been used with metabolic imaging to quantify the activity of disease-specific networks. This approach has helped to characterise the unique metabolic patterns associated with the motor and cognitive features of Parkinson's disease. The results of several studies have shown correction of abnormal motor, but not cognitive, network activity by treatment with dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation. The authors of a longitudinal imaging study of early-stage Parkinson's disease reported substantial differences in the development of these metabolic networks over a follow-up of 4 years. WHERE NEXT?: Developments in network imaging have provided the basis for several new applications of metabolic imaging in the study of Parkinson's disease. A washout study is currently underway to determine the long-duration effects of dopaminergic therapy on the network activity related to Parkinson's disease, which will be useful to plan future trials of disease-modifying drugs. Network approaches are also being applied to the study of atypical parkinsonian syndromes. The characterisation of specific patterns associated with atypical parkinsonian syndromes and classic Parkinson's disease will be the basis for a fully automated imaging-based procedure for early differential diagnosis. Efforts are underway to quantify the networks related to Parkinson's disease with less invasive imaging methods. Assessments of network activity with perfusion-weighted MRI show excellent concordance with measurements done with established radiotracer techniques. This approach will ultimately enable the assessment of abnormal network activity in people who are genetically at risk of Parkinson's disease.},

We hypothesize that microglial activation is an early event in the Parkinson's disease (PD) spectrum and is independent of the amyloid pathology. The aim of this study is to evaluate in vivo the relationship between microglial activation, amyloid deposition, and glucose metabolism in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and PD subjects without dementia. Here, we evaluated 11 PDD subjects, 8 PD subjects without dementia, and 24 control subjects. Subjects underwent T1 and T2 MRI, [(11)C](R)PK11195, [(18)F]FDG, and [(11)C]PIB PET scans. Parametric maps of [(11)C](R)PK11195 binding potential, rCMRGlc, and [(11)C]PIB uptake were interrogated using region of interest and SPM (statistical parametric mapping) analysis. The PDD patients showed a significant increase of microglial activation in anterior and posterior cingulate, striatum, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical regions compared with the controls. The PD subjects also showed a statistically significant increase in microglial activation in temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. [(11)C]PIB uptake was marginally increased in PDD and PD. There was a significant reduction in glucose metabolism in PDD and PD. We have also demonstrated pixel-by-pixel correlation between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and microglial activation, and MMSE score and rCMRGlc. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that cortical microglial activation and reduced glucose metabolism can be detected early on in this disease spectrum. Significant microglial activation may be a factor in driving the disease process in PDD. Given this, agents that affect microglial activation could have an influence on disease progression.},

Here, we measured T1 and T2 times as well as plaques and iron loads in APP/PS1 mice, which model brain amyloidosis, and control PS1 mice. Iron was mostly associated with amyloid deposits in APP/PS1 animals, while it was diffuse in the PS1 mice. T1 was negatively correlated with age in most structures in APP/PS1 animals. This may be related to the age-associated myelin loss described in APP/PS1 mice rather than to amyloid deposition. T2 in the subiculum of adult APP/PS1 animals was lower than in PS1 mice, which may be related to the very high amyloid and iron loads in this region. T2 in the subiculum could thus serve as an early marker of the amyloid pathology. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

HP$\tau$ pathology was observed in the transentorhinal cortex and/or the locus coeruleus (LC) in 33% of the subjects, without any obvious risk factors known to alter the microtubule-associated protein. HP$\tau$ pathology was noted in the LC in 25 out of 83 subjects (30%), lacking concomitant cortical A$\beta$ or transentorhinal HP$\tau$ pathology. This observation was present even when assessing only one routine section of 7 $\mu$m thickness. The recent suggestion of prion-like propagation of neurodegeneration and the finding of neurodegeneration being quite common in middle-aged persons is alarming. It is noteworthy, however, that a substantial number of neurologically unimpaired subjects even at a very old age display only sparse to modest extent of neurodegenerative pathology. Thus, only a subset of subjects with neurodegenerative changes early in life seem to progress to a symptomatic disease with ageing. This observation brings forth the notion that other, yet unknown modifying factors influence the progression of degeneration that leads to a symptomatic disorder. The known association between alterations in the LC and mood disorders, and the finding of the LC being frequently affected with HP$\tau$ pathology suggest that clinicopathological studies on young subjects both with or without mood disorders are warranted.},

abstract = {$\alpha$-Synuclein is central in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Although initially $\alpha$-synuclein was considered a purely intracellular protein, recent data suggest that it can be detected in the plasma and CSF of humans and in the culture media of neuronal cells. To address a role of secreted $\alpha$-synuclein in neuronal homeostasis, we have generated wild-type $\alpha$-synuclein and $\beta$-galactosidase inducible SH-SY5Y cells. Soluble oligomeric and monomeric species of $\alpha$-synuclein are readily detected in the conditioned media (CM) of these cells at concentrations similar to those observed in human CSF. We have found that, in this model, $\alpha$-synuclein is secreted by externalized vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner. Electron microscopy and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry proteomic analysis demonstrate that these vesicles have the characteristic hallmarks of exosomes, secreted intraluminar vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Application of CM containing secreted $\alpha$-synuclein causes cell death of recipient neuronal cells, which can be reversed after $\alpha$-synuclein immunodepletion from the CM. High- and low-molecular-weight $\alpha$-synuclein species, isolated from this CM, significantly decrease cell viability. Importantly, treatment of the CM with oligomer-interfering compounds before application rescues the recipient neuronal cells from the observed toxicity. Our results show for the first time that cell-produced $\alpha$-synuclein is secreted via an exosomal, calcium-dependent mechanism and suggest that $\alpha$-synuclein secretion serves to amplify and propagate Parkinson's disease-related pathology.},

abstract = {Axonal transport is indispensable for the distribution of vesicles, organelles, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and signaling molecules along the axon. This process is mediated by kinesins and dyneins, molecular motors that bind to cargoes and translocate on microtubule tracks. Tight modulation of motor protein activity is necessary, but little is known about the molecules and mechanisms that regulate transport. Moreover, evidence suggests that transport impairments contribute to the initiation or progression of neurodegenerative diseases, or both, but the mechanisms by which motor activity is affected in disease are unclear. In this review, we discuss some of the physical and biophysical properties that influence motor regulation in healthy neurons. We further discuss the evidence for the role of transport in neurodegeneration, highlighting two pathways that may contribute to transport impairment–dependent disease: genetic mutations or variation, and protein aggregation. Understanding how and when transport parameters change in disease will help delineate molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Translocator protein (TSPO) is upregulated in activated microglia and thus can serve as a marker of neuroinflammation. Recently, a novel radioligand, (11)C-N,N-diethyl-2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]-acetamide ((11)C-DPA-713), has been described that binds to TSPO with high affinity. Here, we report the first examination of (11)C-DPA-713 in human subjects using PET. METHODS: Five healthy controls were studied with PET for 90 min after a bolus injection of high-specific-activity (11)C-DPA-713. For comparison, 2 additional healthy controls were studied with (11)C-R-PK11195. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to allow the accurate quantification of tracer kinetics. Tracer uptake was evaluated for several brain regions. Tissue time-activity curves were fitted using 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models, with goodness-of-fit tests showing a preference for the 2-tissue model. RESULTS: In the healthy brain, the average plasma-to-tissue clearance and the total volume of distribution were an order of magnitude larger than measured for (11)C-R-PK11195. Accordingly, dose-normalized time-activity curves showed that (11)C-DPA-713 gives a larger brain signal. CONCLUSION: Studies in patient populations will help determine whether (11)C-DPA-713 provides better sensitivity for evaluating increased TSPO expression. This initial study in humans shows that (11)C-DPA-713 is a promising ligand for evaluating TSPO binding with PET.},

The brain tissue analysed represented white matter with incomplete infarction, complete infarcts and with histologically normal tissue, in cases with dementia, mainly of Alzheimer and multi-infarct type, in nondemented subjects with cerebral infarcts and in age-matched control cases. The biochemical results verify the existence of the white matter changes and agree on their regional distribution as they appear in the morphological analyses. The increasing severity of SIWI as assessed histologically was reflected in a proportional reduction of several biochemically quantified white matter components. The histological difference between incomplete and complete infarction was also expressed biochemically. Incomplete white matter infarction with and without associated complete infarcts were biochemically similar. The aetiological significance of the loss of different white matter components is discussed. The biochemical data support the concept of SIWI as being an independent white matter disorder of cerebrovascular, hypoperfusional/hypoxic origin.},

abstract = {We examined the applicability of manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to the in vivo tracing of diffuse neuromodulatory projections by means of simultaneous iontophoretic injections of an extremely low, non-toxic concentration of MnCl(2) (10mM) and fluorescent dextran in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the rat. We validated the use of the iontophoretic injection by reproducing previously reported results from pressure injections of MnCl(2) in primary somatosensory cortex. Twenty fourhours after injection in LC, Mn(2+) labeling was detected in major cortical and subcortical targets of LC projections including predominantly ipsilateral primary motor and somatosensory cortices, hippocampus and amygdala. Although the injections were in most cases centered in the core of LC, the pattern of Mn(2+) labeling greatly varied across rats. In addition, despite a certain degree of overlap of the labeling obtained with both MEMRI and classical tracing, MEMRI tracing consistently failed to reliably label not only several minor but also major targets of LC, notably the thalamus. The lack of Mn(2+) labeling in thalamus possibly reflected a weaker functional connectivity within coeruleothalamic projections that could not be predicted by anatomical tracing. Inversely, a number of brain regions, particularly contralateral motor cortex, that were not or only sparsely labeled with fluorescent dextran were strongly labeled by Mn(2+). This discrepancy could be partly due to both the activity-dependent and transsynaptic nature of Mn(2+) transport. The overall labeling produced using MEMRI with iontophoretic injections in LC indicates that the Mn(2+) imaging of highly diffuse projections is in principle feasible. However, the labeling pattern of each individual case needs to be carefully interpreted particularly before submitting data for group analysis or in the case of longitudinal examination of discrete changes in functional connectivity under various physiological or behavioral conditions.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a devastating impact on aged people worldwide. Although sophisticated and advanced molecular methods have been developed for its diagnosis since early phases, pharmacological treatment still represents an unresolved topic. The more the disease progresses, the more the uneffectiveness of antidementia drugs emerges. New and encouraging results from experimental works indicate that glutamate pathway may play a substantial role in the pathogenesis since early stages of the disease. Several experimental data together with the clinical use of the uncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine strengthen this idea. Unfortunately, definitive data on the glutamatergic transmission involvement in AD are still incomplete. Moreover, clinical results indicate only temporarily limited effects of memantine. Currently, memantine is indicated for moderate-to-severe cases of AD, an indication that may limit its efficacy and impact on Alzheimer's dementia. The association of memantine with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs used to treat dementia symptoms appears to be beneficial, in both experimental and clinical studies. Because cholinergic and glutamatergic dysfunction occurs early in AD, the coadministration of appropriate treatment in early stages of the disease might represent a valid option from the beginning of cognitive decline. Moreover, to better evaluate drug efficacy, the association of the recently introduced biomarkers with a clinical AD profile should be considered an aim to pursue.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish, using brain spiral computerised tomography (SCT) and modified Barthel index (MBI), whether the location of cerebral infarction could be correlated with functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients who undergo early intensive rehabilitation. METHODS: Observational cohort, assessor blinded and correlational prospective 12-weeks study that included 111 acute ischemic stroke patients, admitted consecutively to an early intensive inpatient rehabilitation programme (5 days a week, 3-5 h a day) during 2003. Confirmation of diagnosis and stratification was done by brain SCT. Brain lesion locations were correlated to motor performance and functional outcome, on admission and discharge, using MBI. RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between motor performance, functional outcome and brain lesion locations. The groups with deep, combined deep and large superficial, small superficial and large superficial infarcts showed the most consistent improvement in that order of frequency. Normal brain SCT group did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.051) while the bi-hemispheric infarcts group did not show any change. The inter and intra group differences were highly significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate non-contrasted brain SCT may act as an independent predictor of final functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke. It may provide clinicians with an opportunity to offer realistic expectations to stroke patients and their relatives.},

abstract = {In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the ANT produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The ANT may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.},

abstract = {Amyloid deposition, tangle formation, neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction are pathological processes involved in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relative role of these processes in driving disease progression is still unclear. The aim of this positron emission tomography study was to: (i) investigate longitudinal changes of microglial activation, amyloid and glucose metabolism; and (ii) assess the temporospatial relationship between these three processes in Alzheimer's disease. A group of eight patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (66 ± 4.8 years) and 14 healthy controls (65 ± 5.5 years) underwent T1 and T2 magnetic resonance imaging, along with (11)C-(R)-PK11195, (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans for microglial activation, amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism. All patients were followed-up with repeated magnetic resonance imaging and three positron emission tomography scans after 16 months. Parametric maps were interrogated using region of interest analysis, Statistical Parametric Mapping, and between-group correlation analysis at voxel-level using Biological Parametric Mapping. At baseline, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly increased microglial activation compared to the control subjects. During follow-up, for the first time, we found that while there is a progressive reduction of glucose metabolism, there was a longitudinal increase of microglial activation in the majority of the patients with Alzheimer's disease. Voxel-wise correlation analysis revealed that microglial activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease was positively correlated with amyloid deposition and inversely correlated with regional cerebral metabolic rate at voxel level over time. Even though one of the limitations of this study is the lack of longitudinal follow-up of healthy control subjects, this study demonstrates that there is persistent neuroinflammation throughout the Alzheimer's disease process with associated synaptic dysfunction and reduced glucose metabolism. Voxel-wise correlation analysis suggests that neuroinflammation is associated with localized amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism over time, however, the level of inflammation could also occur independently of amyloid pathology, especially in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kD (TDP-43) is an aggregation-prone prion-like domain-containing protein and component of pathological intracellular aggregates found in most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. TDP-43 oligomers have been postulated to be released and subsequently nucleate TDP-43 oligomerization in recipient cells, which might be the molecular correlate of the systematic symptom spreading observed during ALS progression. We developed a novel protein complementation assay allowing quantification of TDP-43 oligomers in living cells. We demonstrate the exchange of TDP-43 between cell somata and the presence of TDP-43 oligomers in microvesicles/exosomes and show that microvesicular TDP-43 is preferentially taken up by recipient cells where it exerts higher toxicity than free TDP-43. Moreover, studies using microfluidic neuronal cultures suggest both anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic spreading of TDP-43. Finally, we demonstrate TDP-43 oligomer seeding by TDP-43–containing material derived from both cultured cells and ALS patient brain lysate. Thus, using an innovative detection technique, we provide evidence for preferentially microvesicular uptake as well as both soma-to-soma “horizontal” and bidirectional “vertical” synaptic intercellular transmission and prion-like seeding of TDP-43.},

abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology precedes and induces tau pathology, but the neuropathological connection between these two lesions has not been demonstrated. We examined the regional distribution and co-localization of Abeta and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in synaptic terminals of Alzheimer's disease brains. To quantitatively examine large populations of individual synaptic terminals, flow cytometry was used to analyze synaptosomes prepared from cryopreserved Alzheimer's disease tissue. An average 68.4% of synaptic terminals in the Alzheimer's disease cohort (n = 11) were positive for Abeta, and 32.3% were positive for p-tau; Abeta and p-tau fluorescence was lowest in cerebellum. In contrast to synaptic p-tau, which was highest in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (P = 0.004), synaptic Abeta fluorescence was significantly lower in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus relative to neocortical regions (P = 0.0003). Synaptic Abeta and p-tau fluorescence was significantly correlated (r = 0.683, P <0.004), and dual-labeling experiments demonstrated that 24.1% of Abeta-positive terminals were also positive for p-tau, with the highest fraction of dual labeling (39.3%) in the earliest affected region, the entorhinal cortex. Western blotting experiments show a significant correlation between synaptic Abeta levels measured by flow cytometry and oligomeric Abeta species (P <0.0001). These results showing overlapping Abeta and tau pathology are consistent with a model in which both synaptic loss and dysfunction are linked to a synaptic amyloid cascade within the synaptic compartment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The influence of neuroinflammation on neuronal function and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is still unclear. OBJECTIVES Here we investigated whether microglial activation measured by [11C]PK11195 PET is associated with neuronal function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) using FDG-PET and hippocampal volume measurements. METHODS We enrolled 25 subjects (9 PDD, 8 AD, and 8 controls) who underwent PET scans with [11C](R)PK11195, [18F]FDG, and volumetric MRI scanning. RESULTS SPM correlation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus, while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, providing further evidence for the central role of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Although little is known about the etiology of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), genetic and epigenetic factors, oxidative injury and inflammation are thought to contribute to its development and/or progression. Evidence for activated glia involvement in PSP has raised the possibility that neuroinflammation may contribute to its pathogenesis. To investigate the correlation between neuroinflammation and PSP, a comparative study was conducted on the patterns of cytokine expression in different regions of the brains of PSP, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls. Our results show different patterns of cytokine expression in each disease, with the expression of IL-1$\beta$ transcripts being significantly higher in the substantia nigra of PSP than in AD and controls, while AD brains had significantly higher IL-1$\beta$ expression in the parietal cortex compared to PSP and controls. In addition, expression of TGF$\beta$ was significantly higher in the cortical areas (particularly frontal and parietal lobes) of AD compared to PSP and controls. These results show a disease-specific topographical relationship among the expression of certain cytokines (IL-1$\beta$ and TGF$\beta$), microglial activation and neurodegenerative changes, suggesting that these cytokines may contribute to the pathologic process. If so, the use of cytokine-inhibitors and/or other anti-inflammatory agents may be able to slow disease progression in PSP.},

@article{Fernandez2003,
abstract = {The syndrome of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterised by the clinical triad of fluctuating cognitive impairment, recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. In an attempt to define DLB as a distinct clinical syndrome separate from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia, a consensus workshop in 1995 established a new set of diagnostic criteria. Dementia that precedes or accompanies the onset of spontaneous (i.e., not neuroleptic-induced) Parkinsonism is termed DLB. In addition, fluctuations in alertness, cognition and function and visual hallucinations are emphasised and included as core features of DLB. The degree to which an individual patient exhibits cognitive impairment, behavioural problems and Parkinsonian features is variable. Therefore, treatment must be individualised. Although there are no officially approved drugs for DLB, limited experience from clinical trials, as well as past experience with the treatment of AD and PD patients, provide some basis for making drug choices. The cholinergic deficit seen in DLB makes cholinesterase inhibitor drugs the mainstay of treatment for cognitive impairment. This class of drugs has also shown therapeutic benefit in reducing hallucinations and other neuropsychiatric symptoms of the disease. Because of their relatively greater therapeutic window, cholinesterase inhibitors are also used as first-line therapy for the treatment of psychosis in DLB. Patients with DLB are extremely sensitive to the extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic medications. Thus, only atypical antipsychotic agents such as quetiapine, should be considered as alternative treatment for psychosis. Anxiety and depression are best treated with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, whereas REM sleep behaviour disorder may be treated with low dose clonazepam. Parkinsonism responds to dopaminergic agents; however, precipitation or aggravation of hallucinosis may occur. Levodopa is preferred over dopamine agonists due to its lower propensity to cause hallucinations and somnolence. As the diagnostic criteria for DLB become more refined and validated by postmortem studies, it is hoped that rigorous, well-designed trials will be performed, aimed at alleviating the primary target symptoms of dementia, psychosis and Parkinsonism.},

abstract = {Recent reports have drawn attention to dysfunctions of intrinsic neuronal excitability and network activity in Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we review the possible causes of these basic dysfunctions and implications for AD, based on in vitro and in vivo findings. We then review the current therapeutic approaches particularly linked to the issue of neuronal excitability in AD. Conclusion: AD is a complex, neurodegenerative disorder. Hippocampal synaptic dysfunction is an early feature of the degenerative process that is clearly linked to memory impairment, the first and major symptom of AD. A growing body of evidence points toward a dysfunction of neuronal networks. Intrinsic neuronal excitability, mainly through profound dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, appears to be largely affected. Consequently, neuronal communication is disturbed. Such cellular defects might underlie cognitive manifestations like fluctuations in cognitive impairment and might also explain several observations obtained with EEG, MEG, MRI, or PET studies, leading to the concept of a disconnection syndrome in AD.},

METHODS With data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we conducted voxel-based morphometry to determine areas of gray matter change in the same Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants, before and after they developed delusions. RESULTS We identified 14 voxel clusters with significant gray matter decrease in patient scans post-delusional onset, correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate, p < 0.05). Major areas of difference included the right and left insulae, left precuneus, the right and left cerebellar culmen, the left superior temporal gyrus, the right posterior cingulate, the right thalamus, and the left parahippocampal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS Although contrary to our initial predictions of enhanced right frontal atrophy, our preliminary work identifies several neuroanatomical areas, including the cerebellum and left posterior hemisphere, which may be involved in delusional development in these patients.},

The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging.

This results in substantial invariance to acquisition parameters, as the effect of these parameters on the contrast properties of various brain structures is explicitly modeled in the segmentation. In addition, the integration of image acquisition with tissue classification allows the derivation of sequences that are optimal for segmentation purposes. Another benefit of these procedures is the generation of probabilistic models of the intrinsic tissue parameters that cause MR contrast (e.g., T1, proton density, T2*), allowing access to these physiologically relevant parameters that may change with disease or demographic, resulting in nonmorphometric alterations in MR images that are otherwise difficult to detect. Finally, we also present a high band width multiecho FLASH pulse sequence that results in high signal-to-noise ratio with minimal image distortion due to B0 effects. This sequence has the added benefit of allowing the explicit estimation of T2* and of reducing test-retest intensity variability.},

A$\beta$42 and neurodegenerative biomarkers may precede clinical symptoms, but it is not clear whether AD invariably follows and whether neuropsychological tests are as sensitive. A$\beta$42 is related to plaque burden, which was assumed to be the main cause of AD. Evidence is now pointing to other forms of A$\beta$, for example, soluble A$\beta$ oligomers, and it is possible that plaques are secondary rather than causative to neuronal damage. This makes it less obvious that CSF A$\beta$42 necessarily is the most potent marker. Atrophy has been regarded as a downstream event, but novel MRI analysis techniques detect atrophy at a stage where the cognitive reductions are small and possibly reversible, and MRI is superior to CSF biomarkers in the prediction of cognitive decline. The impact of biomarkers may be dynamic; changed A$\beta$42 is seen in cognitively normal, while atrophy causes decrements later. In conclusion, CSF and MRI biomarkers are extremely important, but it is not known whether they can distinguish events that will lead to AD from events that will not before cognitive reductions are measurable.},

abstract = {Huge progress has been made in unraveling the mysteries of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but we still do not understand the basic mechanisms that set off the cascade of pathological events. In May 2011, the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association published new diagnostic guidelines, expected to have huge impact on AD research and clinical practice. However, the new guidelines are already criticized for being biased in favor of a specific theory of the pathophysiological origins of AD-the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Shortly before publication of the guidelines, a hypothetical model of the dynamic biomarkers of the Alzheimer's pathological cascade was published, taking as starting point that biomarkers reflecting brain levels of amyloid become deviant long before brain atrophy, cognitive dysfunction, or clinical symptoms are manifest. This model has already attracted substantial interest and arguably represents a dominating view within human research on AD. Here we critically review the evidence for the view of amyloid as an initiating event in the pathological cascade and discuss how central assumptions of this hypothesis affect how results from contemporary human AD research are understood. Interpretations of new results are greatly impacted by researchers' view on the role of amyloid, and identical observations are sometimes taken to support radically opposing views on the amyloid hypothesis. We argue that the canonical view of the role of amyloid as the main causal factor in AD may not be correct and that evidence from recent neuroimaging studies indicates that amyloid is neither necessary nor sufficient, for the manifestation of AD-like brain atrophy.},

abstract = {Reduced levels of beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta1-42) and increased levels of tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), likely reflecting Abeta deposition in plaques and neuronal and axonal damage. It is not known whether these biomarkers are associated with brain atrophy also in healthy aging. We tested the relationship between CSF levels of Abeta1-42 and tau (total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181) proteins and 1-year brain atrophy in 71 cognitively normal elderly individuals. Results showed that under a certain threshold value, levels of Abeta1-42 correlated highly with 1-year change in a wide range of brain areas. The strongest relationships were not found in the regions most vulnerable early in AD. Above the threshold level, Abeta1-42 was not related to brain changes, but significant volume reductions as well as ventricular expansion were still seen. It is concluded that Abeta1-42 correlates with brain atrophy and ventricular expansion in a subgroup of cognitively normal elderly individuals but that reductions independent of CSF levels of Abeta1-42 is common. Further research and follow-up examinations over several years are needed to test whether degenerative pathology will eventually develop in the group of cognitively normal elderly individuals with low levels of Abeta1-42.},

abstract = {Brain atrophy and altered CSF levels of amyloid beta (Abeta(42)) and the microtubule-associated protein tau are potent biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology. However, the relationship between CSF biomarkers and brain morphometry is poorly understood. Thus, we addressed the following questions. (1) Can CSF biomarker levels explain the morphometric differences between normal controls (NC) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD? (2) How are CSF biomarkers related to atrophy across the brain? (3) How closely are CSF biomarkers and morphometry related to clinical change [clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-sb)]? Three hundred seventy participants (105 NC, 175 MCI, 90 AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were studied, of whom 309 were followed for 1 year and 176 for 2 years. Analyses were performed across the entire cortical surface, as well as for 30 cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Results showed that CSF biomarker levels could not account for group differences in brain morphometry at baseline but that CSF biomarker levels showed moderate relationships to longitudinal atrophy rates in numerous brain areas, not restricted to medial temporal structures. Baseline morphometry was at least as predictive of atrophy as were CSF biomarkers. Even MCI patients with levels of Abeta(42) comparable with controls and of p-tau lower than controls showed more atrophy than the controls. Morphometry predicted change in CDR-sb better than did CSF biomarkers. These results indicate that morphometric changes in MCI and AD are not secondary to CSF biomarker changes and that the two types of biomarkers yield complementary information.},

abstract = {More than 6 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the incidence is growing rapidly with our aging population. Numerous therapeutics have failed to make it to the clinic, potentially due to a focus on presumptive pathogenic proteins instead of cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms. The tau propagation hypothesis that inter-neuronal tau transfer drives AD pathology has recently garnered attention, as accumulation of pathological tau in the brain has high clinical significance in correlating with progression of cognitive AD symptoms. However, studies on tau pathology in AD are classically neuron-centric and have greatly overlooked cell-type specific effects of tau internalization, degradation, and propagation. While the contribution of microglia to tau processing and propagation is beginning to be recognized and understood, astrocytes, glial cells in the brain important for maintaining neuronal metabolic, synaptic, trophic, and immune function which can produce, internalize, degrade, and propagate tau are understudied in their ability to affect AD progression through tau pathology. Here, we showcase evidence for whether tau uptake by astrocytes may be beneficial or detrimental to neuronal health and how astrocytes and their immunometabolic functions may be key targets for future successful AD therapies.},

Pathologically confirmed IPD encompasses a spectrum of microscopic appearances with respect to the extent and distribution of Lewy Body deposition, which may reflect the clinical phenotypes observed during life. In this review, we discuss how IPD is currently defined and the purpose and applications of a classification of the disease. We have also performed a systematic review of the literature to present the quantitative evidence on which potential classifications of the disease might be based. This evidence suggests that sub-groups based on age of onset, motor presentation, or subsequent motor phenotype may have some use in predicting disease progression. However, further clinico pathological studies are required to evaluate pathological heterogeneity within these groups. Clinical sub-groups may be related to a variety of as yet unknown risks, including genetic factors for both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease, and may have far reaching consequences for our understanding of disease pathogenesis and treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is an adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by L-dopa-resistant rigidity, focal cortical deficits, and variable dementia. The neuropathological hallmark of CBD is the deposition of filamentous inclusions in neurons and glia composed of hyperphosphorylated tau with only four microtubule-binding repeats (4R-tau). To characterize the regional burden of tau pathology in CBD, we studied 12 brains with the neuropathological diagnosis of CBD using biochemical and histochemical techniques. Eleven brain regions were evaluated including gray and white matter from frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes and cerebellum as well as basal ganglia. Although the distribution of tau pathology was variable, neuropathological and biochemical data showed a similar burden of tau abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes and basal ganglia of both hemispheres. This included abundant, sarkosyl-insoluble 4R-tau in both gray and white matter of two or more of these cortical regions and basal ganglia, and to a lesser extent, cerebellar white matter. The insoluble tau pathology in gray and white matter showed overlapping but distinct phosphorylated epitopes suggesting cell-type and subcellular localization (ie, cell bodies versus cell processes)-specific differences in tau phosphorylation. In contrast, soluble tau was composed of normal 4R/3R-tau ratios indicating no gross abnormality in tau splicing. Thus, although clinically heterogeneous, CBD is a distinct lobar and basal ganglionic tauopathy with selective aggregation of 4R-tau.},

abstract = {The prion hypothesis states that misfolded proteins can act as infectious agents that template the misfolding and aggregation of healthy proteins to transmit a disease. Increasing evidence suggests that pathological proteins in neurodegenerative diseases adopt prion-like mechanisms and spread across the brain along anatomically connected networks. Local kinetic models of protein misfolding and global network models of protein spreading provide valuable insight into several aspects of prion-like diseases. Yet, to date, these models have not been combined to simulate how pathological proteins multiply and spread across the human brain. Here, we create an efficient and robust tool to simulate the spreading of misfolded protein using three classes of kinetic models, the Fisher–Kolmogorov model, the Heterodimer model and the Smoluchowski model. We discretize their governing equations using a human brain network model, which we represent as a weighted Laplacian graph generated from 418 brains from the Human Connectome Project. Its nodes represent the anatomic regions of interest and its edges are weighted by the mean fibre number divided by the mean fibre length between any two regions. We demonstrate that our brain network model can predict the histopathological patterns of Alzheimer's disease and capture the key characteristic features of finite-element brain models at a fraction of their computational cost: simulating the spatio-temporal evolution of aggregate size distributions across the human brain throughout a period of 40 years takes less than 7 s on a standard laptop computer. Our model has the potential to predict biomarker curves, aggregate size distributions, infection times, and the effects of therapeutic strategies including reduced production and increased clearance of misfolded protein.},

Here, we combine resting-state fMRI with longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples including 53 (ADNI) and 41 (BioFINDER) amyloid-biomarker defined AD subjects and 28 (ADNI) vs. 16 (BioFINDER) amyloid-negative healthy controls. In both samples, AD subjects show faster tau accumulation than controls. Second, in AD, higher fMRI-assessed connectivity between 400 regions of interest (ROIs) is associated with correlated tau-PET accumulation in corresponding ROIs. Third, we show that a model including baseline connectivity and tau-PET is associated with future tau-PET accumulation. Together, connectivity is associated with tau spread in AD, supporting the view of transneuronal tau propagation.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology spreads hierarchically from the inferior temporal lobe throughout the cortex, ensuing cognitive decline and dementia. Similarly, circumscribed patterns of pathological tau have been observed in normal ageing and small vessel disease, suggesting a spatially ordered distribution of tau pathology across normal ageing and different diseases. In vitro findings suggest that pathological tau may spread prion-like' across neuronal connections in an activity-dependent manner. Supporting this notion, functional brain networks show a spatial correspondence to tau deposition patterns. However, it remains unclear whether higher network-connectivity facilitates tau propagation. To address this, we included 55 normal aged elderly (i.e. cognitively normal, amyloid-negative), 50 Alzheimer's disease patients (i.e. amyloid-positive) covering the preclinical to dementia spectrum, as well as 36 patients with pure (i.e. amyloid-negative) vascular cognitive impairment due to small vessel disease. All subjects were assessed with AV1451 tau-PET and resting-state functional MRI. Within each group, we computed atlas-based resting-state functional MRI functional connectivity across 400 regions of interest covering the entire neocortex. Using the same atlas, we also assessed within each group the covariance of tau-PET levels among the 400 regions of interest. We found that higher resting-state functional MRI assessed functional connectivity between any given region of interest pair was associated with higher covariance in tau-PET binding in corresponding regions of interest. This result was consistently found in normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. In particular, inferior temporal tau-hotspots, as defined by highest tau-PET uptake, showed high predictive value of tau-PET levels in functionally closely connected regions of interest. These associations between functional connectivity and tau-PET uptake were detected regardless of presence of dementia symptoms (mild cognitive impairment or dementia), amyloid deposition (as assessed by amyloid-PET) or small vessel disease. Our findings suggest that higher functional connectivity between brain regions is associated with shared tau-levels, supporting the view of prion-like tau spreading facilitated by neural activity.},

Regional brain atrophy and genetic expression was co-registered to a common 86 region brain atlas and robust multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify genetic predictors of regional brain atrophy. Top candidate genes from GWAS analysis, as well as genes implicated in trans-synaptic alpha-synuclein transfer and autosomal recessive PD were included in our analysis. We identify three genes with expression patterns that are highly significant predictors of regional brain atrophy. The two most significant predictors are LAG3 and RAB5A, genes implicated in trans-synaptic synuclein transfer. Other well-validated PD-related genes do not have expression patterns that predict regional atrophy, suggesting that they may serve other roles such as disease initiation factors.},

abstract = {Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is a rare fatal rapidly progressive dementia caused by the accumulation and spread of pathologically misfolded prions. Evidence from animal models and in vitro experiments suggests that prion pathology propagates along neural connectivity pathways, with the transmission of misfolded prions initiating a corruptive templating process in newly encountered brain regions. Although particular regional patterns of disease have been recognized in humans, the underlying mechanistic basis of these patterns remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial pattern of disease derived from publicly available human diffusion-weighted MRI data demonstrates stereotypical features across patient cohorts and can be largely explained by intrinsic connectivity properties of the human structural brain network. Regional diffusion-weighted MRI signal abnormalities are predicted by graph theoretical measures of centrality, with highly affected regions such as cingulate gyrus demonstrating strong structural connectivity to other brain regions. We employ network diffusion modelling to demonstrate that the spatial pattern of disease can be predicted by a diffusion process originating from a single regional pathology seed and operating on the structural connectome. The most likely seeds correspond to the most highly affected brain regions, suggesting that pathological prions could originate in a single brain region and spread throughout the brain to produce the regional distribution of pathology observed on MRI. Further investigation of top seed regions and associated connectivity pathways may be a useful strategy for developing therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Although a significant genetic contribution to the risk of developing sporadic Parkinson's disease has been well described, the relationship between local genetic factors, pathogenesis, and subsequent spread of pathology throughout the brain has been largely unexplained in humans. To address this question, we use network diffusion modelling to infer probable pathology seed regions and patterns of disease spread from MRI atrophy maps derived from 232 de novo subjects in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative study. Allen Brain Atlas regional transcriptional profiles of 67 Parkinson's disease risk factor genes were mapped to the inferred seed regions to determine the local influence of genetic risk factors. We used hierarchical clustering and L1 regularized regression analysis to show that transcriptional profiles of immune-related and lysosomal risk factor genes predict seed region location and the pattern of disease propagation from the most likely seed region, substantia nigra. By leveraging recent advances in transcriptomics, we show that regional microglial abundance quantified by high fidelity gene expression also predicts seed region location. These findings suggest that early disease sites are genetically susceptible to dysfunctional lysosomal $\alpha$-synuclein processing and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, which may initiate the disease process and contribute to spread of pathology along neural connectivity pathways.},

abstract = {Recent research in C. elegans and the rodent has identified correlations between gene expression and connectivity. Here we extend this type of approach to examine complex patterns of gene expression in the rodent brain in the context of regional brain connectivity and differences in cellular populations. Using multiple large-scale data sets obtained from public sources, we identified two novel patterns of mouse brain gene expression showing a strong degree of anti-correlation, and relate this to multiple data modalities including macroscale connectivity. We found that these signatures are associated with differences in expression of neuronal and oligodendrocyte markers, suggesting they reflect regional differences in cellular populations. We also find that the expression level of these genes is correlated with connectivity degree, with regions expressing the neuron-enriched pattern having more incoming and outgoing connections with other regions. Our results exemplify what is possible when increasingly detailed large-scale cell- and gene-level data sets are integrated with connectivity data.},

abstract = {Objective: The lesions of Parkinson disease spread through the brain in a characteristic pattern that corresponds to axonal projections. Previous observations suggest that misfolded $\alpha$-synuclein could behave as a prion, moving from neuron to neuron and causing endogenous $\alpha$-synuclein to misfold. Here, we characterized and quantified the axonal transport of $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils and showed that fibrils could be transferred from axons to second-order neurons following anterograde transport. Methods: We grew primary cortical mouse neurons in microfluidic devices to separate somata from axonal projections in fluidically isolated microenvironments. We used live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence to characterize the transport of fluorescent $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils and their transfer to second-order neurons. Results: Fibrillar $\alpha$-synuclein was internalized by primary neurons and transported in axons with kinetics consistent with slow component-b of axonal transport (fast axonal transport with saltatory movement). Fibrillar $\alpha$-synuclein was readily observed in the cell bodies of second-order neurons following anterograde axonal transport. Axon-to-soma transfer appeared not to require synaptic contacts. Interpretation: These results support the hypothesis that the progression of Parkinson disease can be caused by neuron-to-neuron spread of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregates and that the anatomical pattern of progression of lesions between axonally connected areas results from the axonal transport of such aggregates. That the transfer did not appear to be trans-synaptic gives hope that $\alpha$-synuclein fibrils could be intercepted by drugs during the extracellular phase of their journey.

abstract = {Clinical observations have suggested that the neuropsychological profile of early and late onset forms of Alzheimer's disease (EOAD and LOAD) differ in that neocortical functions are more affected in the former and learning in the latter, suggesting that they might be different diseases. The aim of this study is to assess the brain structural basis of these observations, and test whether neocortical areas are more heavily affected in EOAD and medial temporal areas in LOAD. Fifteen patients with EOAD and 15 with LOAD (onset before and after age 65; Mini Mental State Examination 19.8, SD 4.0 and 20.7, SD 4.2) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery and high-resolution MRI together with 1:1 age- and sex-matched controls. Cortical atrophy was assessed with cortical pattern matching, and hippocampal atrophy with region-of-interest-based analysis. EOAD patients performed more poorly than LOAD on visuospatial, frontal-executive and learning tests. EOAD patients had the largest atrophy in the occipital [25% grey matter (GM) loss in the left and 24% in the right hemisphere] and parietal lobes (23% loss on both sides), while LOAD patients were remarkably atrophic in the hippocampus (21 and 22% loss). Hippocampal GM loss of EOAD (9 and 16% to the left and right) and occipital (12 and 14%) and parietal (13 and 12%) loss of LOAD patients were less marked. In EOAD, GM loss of 25% or more was mapped to large neocortical areas and affected all lobes, with relative sparing of primary sensory, motor, and visual cortex, and anterior cingulate and orbital cortex. In LOAD, GM loss was diffusely milder (below 15%); losses of 15-20% were confined to temporoparietal and retrosplenial cortex, and reached 25% in restricted areas of the medial temporal lobe and right superior temporal gyrus. These findings indicate that EOAD and LOAD differ in their typical topographic patterns of brain atrophy, suggesting different predisposing or aetiological factors.},

abstract = {Progressive brain atrophy is believed to be the Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker with the greatest evidence for validity. Mapping the topography of cortical atrophy throughout the stages of severity may allow the neural networks affected to be identified. Twenty healthy elderly persons (OH, MMSE 29.1 +/- 1.0), 11 patients with incipient AD (iAD, 26.5 +/- 2.0), 15 with mild AD (miAD, 23.5 +/- 2.2), and 15 with moderate AD (moAD, 16.5 +/- 2.0) underwent 3D magnetic resonance. Cortical pattern matching analysis was performed and maps of percent differences in gray matter distribution were computed between the following groups: iAD versus OH, miAD versus iAD, and moAD versus miAD. Compared to OH, iAD patients exhibited a mean cortical gray matter loss of 9-20% in areas encompassing the polysynaptic hippocampal pathway (posterior cingulate/retrosplenial and medial temporal cortex) and subgenual/orbitofrontal cortices, and a less widespread loss of 5-11% in other neocortical areas. Compared to iAD, miAD featured widespread mean gray matter loss of 14-19% in areas encompassing the direct hippocampal pathway (temporal pole, temporoparietal association cortex, and dorsal prefrontal cortex), sensorimotor, and visual cortex, with a less marked loss (7-9%) in the polysynaptic pathway areas. Compared to miAD, only atrophy in the primary sensorimotor cortex was still relatively marked in moAD, with a mean gray matter loss of 10-11%; the loss in other regions was generally below 10%. These findings suggest that the polysynaptic hippocampal pathway is affected in iAD, the direct pathway and sensorimotor and visual networks are affected in moAD, and the sensorimotor network is affected in moAD.},

These diseases all exhibit features that are reminiscent of those of prionopathies, including phenotypic diversity and the propagation of pathology. Furthermore, emerging studies of amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and tau--proteins implicated in common neurodegenerative diseases--suggest that they share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics with prions. Propagation of protein misfolding in these diseases may therefore occur through mechanisms similar to those that underlie prion pathogenesis. If this hypothesis is verified in vivo, it will suggest new therapeutic strategies to block propagation of protein misfolding throughout the brain.},

abstract = {Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in neurons and glia. Although Tau is normally considered an intracellular protein, Tau aggregates are observed in the extracellular space, and Tau peptide is readily detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Tau aggregation occurs in many diseases, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. Tau pathology begins in discrete, disease-specific regions but eventually involves much larger areas of the brain. It is unknown how this propagation of Tau misfolding occurs. We hypothesize that extracellular Tau aggregates can transmit a misfolded state from the outside to the inside of a cell, similar to prions. Here we show that extracellular Tau aggregates, but not monomer, are taken up by cultured cells. Internalized Tau aggregates displace tubulin, co-localize with dextran, a marker of fluid-phase endocytosis, and induce fibrillization of intracellular full-length Tau. These intracellular fibrils are competent to seed fibril formation of recombinant Tau monomer in vitro. Finally, we observed that newly aggregated intracellular Tau transfers between co-cultured cells. Our data indicate that Tau aggregates can propagate a fibrillar, misfolded state from the outside to the inside of a cell. This may have important implications for understanding how protein misfolding spreads through the brains of tauopathy patients, and it is potentially relevant to myriad neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding.},

abstract = {Tauopathies are sporadic and genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Tau pathology occurs in over 20 phenotypically distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. The molecular basis of this diversity among sporadic tauopathies is unknown, but distinct fibrillar wild-type (WT) Tau conformations could play a role. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and electron microscopy, we show that WT Tau fibrils and P301L/V337M Tau fibrils have distinct secondary structures, fragilities, and morphologies. Furthermore, P301L/V337M fibrillar seeds induce WT Tau monomer to form a novel fibrillar conformation, termed WT*, that is maintained over multiple seeding reactions. WT* has secondary structure, fragility, and morphology that are similar to P301L/V337M fibrils and distinct from WT fibrils. WT Tau is thus capable of conformational diversity that arises via templated conformation change, as has been described for amyloid beta, beta2-microglobulin, and prion proteins.},

Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer's disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub, or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation, whereas BAG3 overexpression attenuated it. These results define a tau homeostasis signature that underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology.},

abstract = {Connectivity is not distributed evenly throughout the brain. Instead, it is concentrated on a small number of highly connected neural elements that act as network hubs. Across different species and measurement scales, these hubs show dense interconnectivity, forming a core or “rich club” that integrates information across anatomically distributed neural systems. Here, we show that projections between connectivity hubs of the mouse brain are both central (i.e., they play an important role in neural communication) and costly (i.e., they extend over long anatomical distances) aspects of network organization that carry a distinctive genetic signature. Analyzing the neuronal connectivity of 213 brain regions and the transcriptional coupling, across 17,642 genes, between each pair of regions, we find that coupling is highest for pairs of connected hubs, intermediate for links between hubs and nonhubs, and lowest for connected pairs of nonhubs. The high transcriptional coupling associated with hub connectivity is driven by genes regulating the oxidative synthesis and metabolism of ATP—the primary energetic currency of neuronal communication. This genetic signature contrasts that identified for neuronal connectivity in general, which is driven by genes regulating neuronal, synaptic, and axonal structure and function. Our findings establish a direct link between molecular function and the large-scale topology of neuronal connectivity, showing that brain hubs display a tight coordination of gene expression, often over long anatomical distances, that is intimately related to the metabolic requirements of these highly active network elements.},

abstract = {Immunohistochemistry and single-cell RT-PCR were used to characterize the localization of huntingtin and/or its mRNA in the major types of striatal neurons and in corticostriatal projection neurons in rats. Single-label immunohistochemical studies revealed that striatum contains scattered large neurons rich in huntingtin and more numerous medium-sized neurons moderate in huntingtin. Double-label immunohistochemical studies showed that the large huntingtin-rich striatal neurons include nearly all cholinergic interneurons and some parvalbuminergic interneurons. Somatostatinergic striatal interneurons, which are medium in size, rarely contained huntingtin. Calbindin immunolabeling showed that the vast majority of the medium-sized striatal neurons that contain huntingtin are projection neurons, but only $\sim$65% of calbindin-labeled projection neurons (localized to the matrix compartment of striatum) were labeled for huntingtin. Calbindin-containing projection neurons of the matrix compartment and calbindin-negative projection neurons of the striatal patch compartment contained huntingtin with comparable frequency. Single-cell RT-PCR confirmed that striatal cholinergic interneurons contain huntingtin, but only $\sim$65% of projection neurons contained detectable huntingtin message. The finding that huntingtin is not consistently found in striatal projection neurons [which die in Huntington's disease (HD)] but is abundant in striatal cholinergic interneurons (which survive in Huntington's disease) suggests that the mutation in huntingtin that causes HD may not directly kill neurons. In contrast to the heterogeneous expression of huntingtin in the different striatal neuron types, we found all corticostriatal neurons to be rich in huntingtin protein and mRNA. One possibility raised by our findings is that the HD mutation may render corticostriatal neurons destructive rather than render striatal neurons vulnerable.},

This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin + inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb + and Vip + inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. Neuropathological and imaging studies have demonstrated a progressive stereotyped accumulation of protein aggregates, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms driving AD progression and vulnerable cell populations affected by disease remain coarsely understood. The current study harnesses the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network experimental practices, combining quantitative neuropathology with single cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics, to understand the impact of disease progression on middle temporal gyrus cell types. We used quantitative neuropathology to place 84 cases spanning the spectrum of AD pathology along a continuous disease pseudoprogression score. We used multiomic technologies to profile single nuclei from each donor, mapping their identity to a common cell type reference with unprecedented resolution. Temporal analysis of cell-type proportions indicated an early reduction of Somatostatin-expressing neuronal subtypes and a late decrease of supragranular intratelencephalic-projecting excitatory and Parvalbumin-expressing neurons, with increases in disease-associated microglial and astrocytic states. We found complex gene expression differences, ranging from global to cell type-specific effects. These effects showed different temporal patterns indicating diverse cellular perturbations as a function of disease progression. A subset of donors showed a particularly severe cellular and molecular phenotype, which correlated with steeper cognitive decline. We have created a freely available public resource to explore these data and to accelerate progress in AD research at SEA-AD.org.},

RBD can cause sleep disruption and severe injuries for the patient or bed partner. The disorder is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and progressive supranuclear palsy. In many cases, the symptoms of RBD precede other symptoms of these neurodegenerative disorders by several years. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that RBD is associated with abnormalities of electroencephalographic activity, cerebral blood flow, and cognitive, perceptual, and autonomic functions. RBD might be a stage in the development of neurodegenerative disorders and increased awareness of this could lead to substantial advances in knowledge of mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {The construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to identify patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the pre-clinical stage. Although subjects with MCI have an increased risk of progressing to dementia, most remain stable or return to normality. The new criteria for diagnosing prodromal AD assume that, to increase the predictive value of the MCI, in addition to a defect of delayed recall there must also be the presence of abnormal biomarkers, investigating structural and molecular neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis of amyloid-$\beta$ or tau proteins. Although acknowledging that the use of CSF degeneration biomarkers is advisable not only for research, but also for clinical purposes, the present review is centered upon the neuropsychological markers of conversion to AD, which are equally clinically important. In particular, results of this review suggest the following: (a) measures of delayed recall are the best neuropsychological predictors of conversion from MCI to AD; (b) memory tests providing controlled encoding and cued recall are not necessarily better predictors than free recall tests; (c) stringent cut-off points are necessary to increase the specificity of these predictors; (d) multi-domain amnestic MCI patients are the best candidates for clinical trials, but not for treatment with disease-modifying drugs; and (e) not only episodic but also semantic memory is significantly impaired in patients who will convert to AD. These data and the underlying neural mechanisms will be discussed, trying to distinguish results obtained in MCI patients from those obtained in a pre-MCI stage of the AD progression.},

abstract = {Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified.},

abstract = {Cumulative evidence indicates that the onset and severity of Huntington's disease (HD) symptoms correlate with connectivity deficits involving specific neuronal populations within cortical and basal ganglia circuits. Brain imaging studies and pathological reports further associated these deficits with alterations in cerebral white matter structure and axonal pathology. However, whether axonopathy represents an early pathogenic event or an epiphenomenon in HD remains unknown, nor is clear the identity of specific neuronal populations affected. To directly evaluate early axonal abnormalities in the context of HD in vivo, we bred transgenic YFP(J16) with R6/2 mice, a widely used HD model. Diffusion tensor imaging and fluorescence microscopy studies revealed a marked degeneration of callosal axons long before the onset of motor symptoms. Accordingly, a significant fraction of YFP-positive cortical neurons in YFP(J16) mice cortex were identified as callosal projection neurons. Callosal axon pathology progressively worsened with age and was influenced by polyglutamine tract length in mutant huntingtin (mhtt). Degenerating axons were dissociated from microscopically visible mhtt aggregates and did not result from loss of cortical neurons. Interestingly, other axonal populations were mildly or not affected, suggesting differential vulnerability to mhtt toxicity. Validating these results, increased vulnerability of callosal axons was documented in the brains of HD patients. Observations here provide a structural basis for the alterations in cerebral white matter structure widely reported in HD patients. Collectively, our data demonstrate a dying-back pattern of degeneration for cortical projection neurons affected in HD, suggesting that axons represent an early and potentially critical target for mhtt toxicity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Huntington's Disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive deterioration of specific brain nerve cells. The current evaluation of cellular and physiological events in patients with HD relies on the development of transgenic animal models. To explore such events in vivo, diffusion tensor imaging has been developed to examine the early macro and microstructural changes in brain tissue. However, the gap in diffusion tensor imaging findings between animal models and clinical studies and the lack of microstructural confirmation by histological methods has questioned the validity of this method. OBJECTIVE This review explores white and grey matter ultrastructural changes associated to diffusion tensor imaging, as well as similarities and differences between preclinical and clinical Huntington's Disease studies. METHODS A comprehensive review of the literature using online-resources was performed (Pub- Med search). RESULTS Similar changes in fractional anisotropy as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivities were observed in white matter tracts across clinical and animal studies. However, comparative diffusion alterations in different grey matter structures were inconsistent between clinical and animal studies. CONCLUSION Diffusion tensor imaging can be related to specific structural anomalies in specific cellular populations. However, some differences between animal and clinical studies could derive from the contrasting neuroanatomy or connectivity across species. Such differences should be considered before generalizing preclinical results into the clinical practice. Moreover, current limitations of this technique to accurately represent complex multicellular events at the single micro scale are real. Future work applying complex diffusion models should be considered.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Twin studies using selected samples have shown high heritability for Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate genetic and environmental influences on AD in a fully ascertained population of older twins, including like- and unlike-sex pairs. DESIGN: Five-group quantitative genetic model: male monozygotic twins, female monozygotic twins, male dizygotic twins, female dizygotic twins, and unlike-sex twins. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All twins in the Swedish Twin Registry aged 65 years and older. The study included 11,884 twin pairs, among whom were 392 pairs in which 1 or both members had AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All individuals were screened for cognitive dysfunction. Suspected cases of dementia and their co-twins received complete clinical diagnostic evaluations for AD. Estimates of heritability, shared environmental influences, and nonshared environmental influences, adjusting for age, were derived from the twin data. RESULTS: Heritability for AD was estimated to be 58% in the full model and 79% in the best-fitting model, with the balance of variation explained by nonshared environmental influences. There were no significant differences between men and women in prevalence or heritability after controlling for age. Within pairs concordant for AD, intrapair difference in age at onset was significantly greater in dizygotic than in monozygotic pairs, suggesting genetic influences on timing of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest twin study to date, we confirmed that heritability for AD is high and that the same genetic factors are influential for both men and women. However, nongenetic risk factors also play an important role and might be the focus for interventions to reduce disease risk or delay disease onset.},

abstract = {Polyglutamine expansion (polyQ) in the protein huntingtin is pathogenic and responsible for the neuronal toxicity associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Although wild-type huntingtin possesses antiapoptotic properties, the relationship between the neuroprotective functions of huntingtin and pathogenesis of HD remains unclear. Here, we show that huntingtin specifically enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) along microtubules. Huntingtin-mediated transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1) and the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular motors. BDNF transport is attenuated both in the disease context and by reducing the levels of wild-type huntingtin. The alteration of the huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlates with reduced association of motor proteins with microtubules. Finally, we find that the polyQ-huntingtin-induced transport deficit results in the loss of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Our findings indicate that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and suggest that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.},

With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments.},

Eight PD patients were examined longitudinally, and their [11C](R)-PK11195 signal remained stable over 2 years. Levels of microglial activation did not correlate with clinical severity or putamen [18F]-dopa uptake. Our in vivo findings confirm that widespread microglial activation is associated with the pathological process in PD.

[11C](R)-PK11195 PET reveals a pattern of increased microglial activation in CBD patients involving cortical regions and the basal ganglia that corresponds well with the known distribution of neuropathological changes, which may therefore help to characterize in vivo the underlying disease activity in CBD.},

abstract = {Tau misfolding and aggregation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which have long been considered one of the main pathological hallmarks for numerous neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, recent studies completed both in vitro and in vivo suggest that intermediate forms of tau, known as tau oligomers, between the monomeric form and NFTs are the true toxic species in disease and the best targets for anti-tau therapies. However, the exact mechanism by which the spread of pathology occurs is unknown. Evidence suggests that tau oligomers may act as templates for the misfolding of native tau, thereby seeding the spread of the toxic forms of the protein. Recently, researchers have reported the ability of tau oligomers to enter and exit cells, propagating from disease-affected regions to unaffected areas. While the mechanism by which the spreading of misfolded tau occurs has yet to be elucidated, there are a few different models which have been proposed, including cell membrane stress and pore-formation, endocytosis and exocytosis, and non-traditional secretion of protein not enclosed by a membrane. Coming to an understanding of how toxic tau species seed and spread through the brain will be crucial to finding effective treatments for neurodegenerative tauopathies.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between stereologic estimates of AD-related pathology and severity of cognitive deficits in brain aging. Background: Previous studies reported substantial contributions of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), amyloid deposits, and neuronal loss to the development of dementia. However, the prediction of cognitive status based on nonstereologic quantification of these measures has led to conflicting results. Such studies have measured densities, rather than absolute numbers, and most do not take into account the potential interaction between the above pathologic hallmarks in a global multivariate analysis. Methods: Clinicopathologic study in 22 elderly cases. Cognitive status assessed prospectively using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); stereologic assessment of NFT, unaffected neurons, and total amyloid volume in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and area 9. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Results: High total NFT counts but not amyloid volume were strongly associated with a lower number of unaffected neurons in all areas studied. A high proportion of variability in MMSE scores was explained by NFT and neuronal counts in the CA1 field (83% and 85.4%), entorhinal cortex (87.8% and 83.7%), and area 9 (87% and 79%); amyloid volume in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the CA1 field and area 9, accounted for 58.5% of MMSE variability. Multivariate analyses showed that total NFT counts in the entorhinal cortex and area 9 as well as neuron numbers in the CA1 field were the best predictors of MMSE score. Conclusions: These new stereologic data indicate that neuronal pathology in hippocampal formation and frontal cortex closely reflects the progression of cognitive deficits in brain aging and AD. They also demonstrate that amyloid volume has no additional predictive value, in terms of clinicopathologic correlations, beyond its interaction with NFT.},

abstract = {Considerable evidence suggests that oxidative stress (elevated levels of reactive oxygen species), altered energy metabolism, and changes in calcium dynamics are central to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormalities in each of these processes occur in AD, and they can be plausibly linked to the pathology and clinical outcome of the disease. Abnormalities in these same processes in peripheral tissues, such as fibroblasts, indicate that these are inherent properties of AD cells and are not merely a secondary response to neurodegeneration. Results in cultured cells including fibroblasts demonstrate that oxidative stress can lead to the AD-related changes in calcium and energy metabolism. Data also suggest that abnormalities in the cellular calcium stores, the ability to handle oxidative stress, and to respond to metabolic impairment link the AD-causing gene mutations to the disease process. Abnormal metabolism and oxidative stress alter the proteins and cellular processes that are modified in AD, and can be readily linked to neuronal death and brain dysfunction. Prevention and/or correction of these abnormalities are appropriate therapeutic targets.},

However, little is known about how wakefulness and sleep affect synapses. Using Western blots and confocal microscopy in Drosophila , we found that protein levels of key components of central synapses were high after waking and low after sleep. These changes were related to behavioral state rather than time of day and occurred in all major areas of the Drosophila brain. The decrease of synaptic markers during sleep was progressive, and sleep was necessary for their decline. Thus, sleep may be involved in maintaining synaptic homeostasis altered by waking activities.},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

abstract = {Interstitial concentration of amyloid beta (A{\ss}) is positively related to synaptic activity in animal experiments. In humans, A{\ss} deposition in Alzheimer's disease overlaps with cortical regions highly active earlier in life. White matter lesions (WML) disrupt connections between gray matter (GM) regions which in turn changes their activation patterns. Here, we tested if WML are related to A{\ss} accumulation (measured with PiB-PET) and glucose uptake (measured with FDG-PET) in connected GM. WML masks from 72 cognitively normal (age 61.7±9.6years, 71% women) individuals were obtained from T2-FLAIR. MRI and PET images were normalized into common space, segmented and parcellated into gray matter (GM) regions. The effects of WML on connected GM regions were assessed using the Change in Connectivity (ChaCo) score. Defined for each GM region, ChaCo is the percentage of WM tracts connecting to that region that pass through the WML mask. The regional relationship between ChaCo, glucose uptake and A{\ss} was explored via linear regression. Subcortical regions of the bilateral caudate, putamen, calcarine, insula, thalamus and anterior cingulum had WM connections with the most lesions, followed by frontal, occipital, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions. Regional analysis revealed that GM with more lesions in connecting WM and thus impaired connectivity had lower FDG-PET (r=0.20, p<0.05 corrected) and lower PiB uptake (r=0.28, p<0.05 corrected). Regional regression also revealed that both ChaCo ($\beta$=0.045) and FDG-PET ($\beta$=0.089) were significant predictors of PiB. In conclusion, brain regions with more lesions in connecting WM had lower glucose metabolism and lower A{\ss} deposition.},

However, the neurobiological bases of WM microstructural declines in presymptomatic AD are unknown. In the present study we address this issue using a multimodal imaging approach to the study of presymptomatic AD. Participants were 37 high-risk (both family history of dementia and one or more APOE4 alleles) women and 20 low-risk (neither family history nor APOE4) women. Groups were matched for age, education, neuropsychological performance, and vascular factors that could affect white matter. Whole-brain analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data [including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA) and radial diffusivity (DR)] and volumetric comparisons of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures were conducted. Results indicated equivalent entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volumes between risk groups. Nevertheless, the high risk group showed decreased microstructural integrity in WM tracts with direct and secondary connections to the MTL. The predominant alteration in WM integrity in the high AD-risk group was decreased FA not solely driven by either DA or DR changes alone in regions where no MD changes were observed. A second pattern observed in a smaller number of regions involved decreased FA and increased DR. These results suggest that disconnection of MTL-neocortical fiber pathways represents a very early event in the course of AD and suggest that demyelination may represent one contributing mechanism.},

Gray matter voxel-based morphometry analysis of T1 magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed in 65 amnestic-MCI subjects. MCI APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers compared with non-carriers showed increased brain atrophy in right hippocampus and rostral amygdala, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and right parietal operculum, including inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal, and supramarginal gyrus. MAPT-H1/H1 MCI carriers showed an increased bilateral atrophy in superior frontal gyri (including frontal eye fields and left prefrontal cortex) and precentral gyrus but also unilateral left atrophy in the inferior temporal gyrus and calcarine gyrus. In addition, MCI subjects carrying both APOE $\epsilon$4 and MAPT-H1/H1 variants showed gray matter loss in the supplementary motor area and right pre- and postcentral gyri. The effect of APOE $\epsilon$4 on gray matter loss in right hippocampus suggests that, at least in some AD sub-types, the neuronal vulnerability could be increased in the right hemisphere. The pattern of frontal gray matter loss observed among MCI MAPT H1/H1 carriers has also been found in other tauopathies, suggesting that MCI may share etiological factors with other tauopathies. Frontal and parietal cortex vulnerability was found when adding MAPT H1/H1 and APOE $\epsilon$4 effects, suggesting a synergistic effect of these variants. These results could be due to changes in APOE $\epsilon$4 and MAPT expression.},

abstract = {Objective: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterized by isolated decline in language functions. Semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia are accepted PPA variants. A "logopenic" variant (LPA) has also been proposed, but its cognitive and anatomic profile is less defined. The aim of this study was to establish the cognitive and anatomic features of LPA. Methods: Six previously unreported LPA cases underwent extensive neuropsychological evaluation and an experimental study of phonological loop functions, including auditory and visual span tasks with digits, letters, and words. For each patient, a voxel-wise, automated analysis of MRI or SPECT data were conducted using SPM2. Results: In LPA, speech rate was slow, with long word-finding pauses. Grammar and articulation were preserved, although phonological paraphasias could be present. Repetition and comprehension were impaired for sentences but preserved for single words, and naming was moderately affected. Investigation of phonological loop functions showed that patients were severely impaired in digit, letter, and word span tasks. Performance did not improve with pointing, was influenced by word length, and did not show the normal phonological similarity effect. Atrophy or decreased blood flow was consistently found in the posterior portion of the left superior and middle temporal gyri and inferior parietal lobule. Conclusions: Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) is a distinctive variant of primary progressive aphasia. Cognitive and neuroimaging data indicate that a deficit in phonological loop functions may be the core mechanism underlying the LPA clinical syndrome. Recent studies suggest that Alzheimer disease may be the most common pathology underlying the LPA clinical syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2008 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract = {We performed a comprehensive cognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic study of 31 patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a decline in language functions that remains isolated for at least 2 years. Detailed speech and language evaluation was used to identify three different clinical variants: nonfluent progressive aphasia (NFPA; n = 11), semantic dementia (SD; n = 10), and a third variant termed logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA; n = 10). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on MRIs showed that, when all 31 PPA patients were analyzed together, the left perisylvian region and the anterior temporal lobes were atrophied. However, when each clinical variant was considered separately, distinctive patterns emerged: (1) NFPA, characterized by apraxia of speech and deficits in processing complex syntax, was associated with left inferior frontal and insular atrophy; (2) SD, characterized by fluent speech and semantic memory deficits, was associated with anterior temporal damage; and (3) LPA, characterized by slow speech and impaired syntactic comprehension and naming, showed atrophy in the left posterior temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 haplotype frequency was 20% in NFPA, 0% in SD, and 67% in LPA. Cognitive, genetic, and anatomical features indicate that different PPA clinical variants may correspond to different underlying pathological processes.},

While the genetic causes of the rare familial inherited forms of AD are understood, the causes of the sporadic forms of the disease are not. Histopathologically, these two forms of AD are indistinguishable: they are characterized by amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide-containing amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. In this review we compare AD to frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a subset of which is characterized by tau deposition in the absence of overt plaques. A host of transgenic animal AD models have been established through the expression of human proteins with pathogenic mutations previously identified in familial AD and FTD. Determining how these mutant proteins cause disease in vivo should contribute to an understanding of the causes of the more frequent sporadic forms. We discuss the insight transgenic animal models have provided into A$\beta$ and tau toxicity, also with regards to mitochondrial function and the crucial role tau plays in mediating A$\beta$ toxicity. We also discuss the role of miRNAs in mediating the toxic effects of the A$\beta$ peptide.},

abstract = {Of all forms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent. It is histopathologically characterized by beta-amyloid-containing plaques, tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, reduced synaptic density and neuronal loss in selected brain areas. For the rare familial forms of Alzheimer's disease, pathogenic mutations have been identified in both the gene encoding the precursor of the Abeta peptide, APP, itself and in the presenilin genes which encode part of the APP-protease complex. For the more frequent sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease, the pathogenic trigger has not been unambiguously identified. Whether Abeta is again the main cause remains to be heavily discussed. In a related disorder termed frontotemporal dementia, which is characterized by tangles in the absence of beta-amyloid deposition, mutations have been identified in tau which also lead to neurodegeneration and dementia. For Alzheimer's disease the existence of familial forms lead to the proposition of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which claims that beta-amyloid causes or enhances the tangle pathology. In this review, we describe tau transgenic mouse models in which aspects of the tau-associated pathology, including tangle formation, has been achieved. Moreover, tau transgenic mouse and tissue-culture models were used to test the amyloid cascade hypothesis. In addition, we discuss alternative hypotheses to explain the sporadic forms. The animal and tissue-culture models will provide insight into the underlying biochemical mechanisms of tau aggregation and nerve cell degeneration. These mechanisms may be partially shared between sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the familial forms and frontotemporal dementia. Eventually, Alzheimer's disease may be redefined based on biochemical events rather than phenotype.},

abstract = {$\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. In the past, there has been a major research drive focused on the dysfunction of the glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is now growing evidence in support of a GABAergic contribution to the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. Previous studies paint a complex, convoluted and often inconsistent picture of AD-associated GABAergic remodeling. Given the importance of the GABAergic system in neuronal function and homeostasis, in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory balance, and in the processes of learning and memory, such changes in GABAergic function could be an important factor in both early and later stages of AD pathogenesis. Given the limited scope of currently available therapies in modifying the course of the disease, a better understanding of GABAergic remodeling in AD could open up innovative and novel therapeutic opportunities.},

abstract = {Recent functional imaging studies have revealed coactivation in a distributed network of cortical regions that characterizes the resting state, or default mode, of the human brain. Among the brain regions implicated in this network, several, including the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobes, have also shown decreased metabolism early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reasoned that default-mode network activity might therefore be abnormal in AD. To test this hypothesis, we used independent component analysis to isolate the network in a group of 13 subjects with mild AD and in a group of 13 age-matched elderly controls as they performed a simple sensory-motor processing task. Three important findings are reported. Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups, suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic memory processing. The AD group showed decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted connectivity between these two regions accounts for the posterior cingulate hypometabolism commonly detected in positron emission tomography studies of early AD. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis applied at the individual subject level suggests that activity in the default-mode network may ultimately prove a sensitive and specific biomarker for incipient AD.},

abstract = {The role of glial inflammatory processes in Alzheimer's disease has been highlighted by recent epidemiological work establishing head trauma as an important risk factor, and the use of anti-inflammatory agents as an important ameliorating factor, in this disease. This review advances the hypothesis that chronic activation of glial inflammatory processes, arising from genetic or environmental insults to neurons and accompanied by chronic elaboration of neuroactive glia-derived cytokines and other proteins, sets in motion a cytokine cycle of cellular and molecular events with neurodegenerative consequences. In this cycle, interleukin-1 is a key initiating and coordinating agent. Interleukin-1 promotes neuronal synthesis and processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein, thus favoring continuing deposition of beta-amyloid, and activates astrocytes and promotes astrocytic synthesis and release of a number of inflammatory and neuroactive molecules. One of these, S100beta, is a neurite growth-promoting cytokine that stresses neurons through its trophic actions and fosters neuronal cell dysfunction and death by raising intraneuronal free calcium concentrations. Neuronal injury arising from these cytokine-induced neuronal insults can activate microglia with further overexpression of interleukin-1, thus producing feedback amplification and self-propagation of this cytokine cycle. Additional feedback amplification is provided through other elements of the cycle. Chronic propagation of this cytokine cycle represents a possible mechanism for progression of neurodegenerative changes culminating in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by plaques of amyloid beta (A$\beta$) and neurofibrillary tangles of tau. A$\beta$ aggregation is thought to occur at early stages of the disease, and ultimately gives way to the formation of tau tangles which track with cognitive decline in humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of an A$\beta$ core segment determined by MicroED and in it, note characteristics of both fibrillar and oligomeric structure. Using this structure, we designed peptide-based inhibitors that reduce A$\beta$ aggregation and toxicity of already-aggregated species. Unexpectedly, we also found that these inhibitors reduce the efficiency of A$\beta$-mediated tau aggregation, and moreover reduce aggregation and self-seeding of tau fibrils. The ability of these inhibitors to interfere with both A$\beta$ and tau seeds suggests these fibrils share a common epitope, and supports the hypothesis that cross-seeding is one mechanism by which amyloid is linked to tau aggregation and could promote cognitive decline.},

abstract = {In this study, a novel partially parallel acquisition (PPA) method is presented which can be used to accelerate image acquisition using an RF coil array for spatial encoding. This technique, GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) is an extension of both the PILS and VD-AUTO-SMASH reconstruction techniques. As in those previous methods, a detailed, highly accurate RF field map is not needed prior to reconstruction in GRAPPA. This information is obtained from several k-space lines which are acquired in addition to the normal image acquisition. As in PILS, the GRAPPA reconstruction algorithm provides unaliased images from each component coil prior to image combination. This results in even higher SNR and better image quality since the steps of image reconstruction and image combination are performed in separate steps. After introducing the GRAPPA technique, primary focus is given to issues related to the practical implementation of GRAPPA, including the reconstruction algorithm as well as analysis of SNR in the resulting images. Finally, in vivo GRAPPA images are shown which demonstrate the utility of the technique.},

abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetic fields (ERFs) are typically analyzed via ANOVAs on mean activity in a priori windows. Advances in computing power and statistics have produced an alternative, mass univariate analyses consisting of thousands of statistical tests and powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Such analyses are most useful when one has little a priori knowledge of effect locations or latencies, and for delineating effect boundaries. Mass univariate analyses complement and, at times, obviate traditional analyses. Here we review this approach as applied to ERP/ERF data and four methods for multiple comparison correction: strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER) via permutation tests, weak control of FWER via cluster-based permutation tests, false discovery rate control, and control of the generalized FWER. We end with recommendations for their use and introduce free MATLAB software for their implementation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Psychophysiological Research.},

@article{Guerra2011,
abstract = {Although motor deficits affect patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) only at later stages, recent studies demonstrated that primary motor cortex is precociously affected by neuronal degeneration. It is conceivable that neuronal loss is compensated by reorganization of the neural circuitries, thereby maintaining motor performances in daily living. Effectively several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have demonstrated that cortical excitability is enhanced in AD and primary motor cortex presents functional reorganization. Although the best hypothesis for the pathogenesis of AD remains the degeneration of cholinergic neurons in specific regions of the basal forebrain, the application of specific TMS protocols pointed out a role of other neurotransmitters. The present paper provides a perspective of the TMS techniques used to study neurophysiological aspects of AD showing also that, based on different patterns of cortical excitability, TMS may be useful in discriminating between physiological and pathological brain aging at least at the group level. Moreover repetitive TMS might become useful in the rehabilitation of AD patients. Finally integrated approaches utilizing TMS together with others neuro-physiological techniques, such as high-density EEG, and structural and functional imaging as well as biological markers are proposed as promising tool for large-scale, low-cost, and noninvasive evaluation of at-risk populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, two large genome wide association studies in Alzheimer disease (AD) have identified variants in three different genes (CLU, PICALM and CR1) as being associated with the risk of developing AD. The strongest association was reported for an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in CLU. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To further characterize this association we have sequenced the coding region of this gene in a total of 495 AD cases and 330 healthy controls. A total of twenty-four variants were found in both cases and controls. For the changes found in more than one individual, the genotypic frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Coding variants were found in both groups (including a nonsense mutation in a healthy subject), indicating that the pathogenicity of variants found in this gene must be carefully evaluated. We found no common coding variant associated with disease. In order to determine if common variants at the CLU locus effect expression of nearby (cis) mRNA transcripts, an expression quantitative loci (eQTL) analysis was performed. No significant eQTL associations were observed for the SNPs previously associated with AD. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that common coding variability at this locus does not explain the association, and that there is no large effect of common genetic variability on expression in brain tissue. We surmise that the most likely mechanism underpinning the association is either small effects of genetic variability on resting gene expression, or effects on damage induced expression of the protein.},

abstract = {All neocortical areas receive thalamic inputs. Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.},

abstract = {A kinetic modeling approach for the quantification of in vivo tracer studies with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is presented. The approach is based on a general compartmental description of the tracer's fate in vivo and determines a parsimonious model consistent with the measured data. The technique involves the determination of a sparse selection of kinetic basis functions from an overcomplete dictionary using the method of basis pursuit denoising. This enables the characterization of the systems impulse response function from which values of the systems macro parameters can be estimated. These parameter estimates can be obtained from a region of interest analysis or as parametric images from a voxel-based analysis. In addition, model order estimates are returned that correspond to the number of compartments in the estimated compartmental model. Validation studies evaluate the methods performance against two preexisting data led techniques, namely, graphical analysis and spectral analysis. Application of this technique to measured PET data is demonstrated using [ 11 C]diprenorphine (opiate receptor) and [ 11 C]WAY-100635 (5-HT1A receptor). Although the method is presented in the context of PET neuroreceptor binding studies, it has general applicability to the quantification of PET/SPECT radiotracer studies in neurology, oncology, and cardiology.},

@article{Guo2006,
abstract = {To date, there is no reasonable explanation as to why plaques and tangles simultaneously accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate here by Western blotting and ELISA that a stable complex can form between tau and amyloid-$\beta$ protein (A$\beta$). This complex enhances tau phosphorylation by GSK3$\beta$, but the phosphorylation then promotes dissociation of the complex. We have localized the sites of this interaction by using peptide membrane arrays. A$\beta$ binds to multiple tau peptides, especially those in exons 7 and 9. This binding is sharply reduced or abolished by phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues. Conversely, tau binds to multiple A$\beta$ peptides in the mid to C-terminal regions of A$\beta$. This binding is also significantly decreased by GSK3$\beta$ phosphorylation of tau. We used surface plasmon resonance to determine the binding affinity of A$\beta$ for tau and found it to be in the low nanomolar range and almost 1,000-fold higher than tau for itself. In soluble extracts from AD and control brain tissue, we detected A$\beta$ bound to tau in ELISAs. We also found by double immunostaining of AD brain tissue that phosphorylated tau and A$\beta$ form separate insoluble complexes within the same neurons and their processes. We hypothesize that in AD, an initial step in the pathogenesis may be the intracellular binding of soluble A$\beta$ to soluble nonphosphorylated tau, thus promoting tau phosphorylation and A$\beta$ nucleation. Blocking the sites where A$\beta$ initially binds to tau might arrest the simultaneous formation of plaques and tangles in AD.},

Cell culture and animal studies showed that tau fibrils can undergo cell-to-cell transmission and seed aggregation of soluble tau, but this phenomenon was only robustly demonstrated in models overexpressing tau. In this study, we found that intracerebral inoculation of tau fibrils purified from AD brains (AD-tau), but not synthetic tau fibrils, resulted in the formation of abundant tau inclusions in anatomically connected brain regions in nontransgenic mice. Recombinant human tau seeded by AD-tau revealed unique conformational features that are distinct from synthetic tau fibrils, which could underlie the differential potency in seeding physiological levels of tau to aggregate. Therefore, our study establishes a mouse model of sporadic tauopathies and points to important differences between tau fibrils that are generated artificially and authentic ones that develop in AD brains.},

Drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of AD and unfortunately almost all clinical trials of AD drug candidates have failed or been discontinued to date. Mathematical, computational and statistical tools can be employed in the construction of clinical trial simulators to assist in the improvement of trial design and enhance the chances of success of potential new therapies. Based on the analysis of a set of clinical data provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) we developed a simple stochastic mathematical model to simulate the development and progression of Alzheimer's in a longitudinal cohort study. We show how this modelling framework could be used to assess the effect and the chances of success of hypothetical treatments that are administered at different stages and delay disease development. We demonstrate that the detection of the true efficacy of an AD treatment can be very challenging, even if the treatment is highly effective. An important reason behind the inability to detect signals of efficacy in a clinical trial in this therapy area could be the high between- and within-individual variability in the measurement of diagnostic markers and endpoints, which consequently results in the misdiagnosis of an individual's disease state.},

An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants.

abstract = {Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia have been associated with striatal degeneration, but few studies have delineated striatal subregion volumes in vivo or related them to the clinical phenotype. We traced caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens on magnetic resonance images to quantify volumes of these structures in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, Alzheimer disease, and healthy controls (n=12 per group). We further related these striatal volumes to clinical deficits and neuropathologic findings in a subset of patients. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia showed significant overall striatal atrophy compared with controls. Moreover, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia showed panstriatal degeneration, whereas semantic dementia featured a more focal pattern involving putamen and accumbens. Right-sided striatal atrophy, especially in the putamen, correlated with the overall behavioral symptom severity and with specific behavioral domains. At autopsy, patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia showed striking and severe tau or TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa pathology, especially in ventral parts of the striatum. These results demonstrate that ventral striatum degeneration is a prominent shared feature in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia and may contribute to the social-emotional deficits common to both disorders.},

abstract = {One of the most marked differences to be identified in Parkinson's disease is the change in activity of thalamic neurons in the motor circuits. Because dopamine replacement therapies largely alleviate these motor circuit abnormalities, it has been assumed that pathology in the basal ganglia is entirely responsible for the aberrant thalamic activity which then permeates the motor circuits. However, there is considerable evidence that pathology in the thalamus itself contributes to the abnormal neural activity characteristic of Parkinson's disease. In a series of studies examining the degree of degeneration in the thalamus, we have observed selective degeneration in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei in patients with levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease. The nuclei involved are the caudal intralaminar nuclei (the centre-median/parafascicular complex), the parataenial, cucullar and central lateral nuclei. The centre-median/parafascicular complex provides important glutaminergic feedback from the thalamus to the putamen and is a pathway that is greatly enlarged in primates. There is 30-40% loss in this region of the thalamus in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with non-parvalbumin-containing neurons degenerating the most (70% average loss). Our recent work suggests that the preservation of this pathway may contribute to dystonia in Parkinson's disease. The central lateral and cucullar thalamic nuclei degenerate 30-50%, while the parataenial nucleus sustains a 55% loss of neurons in association with significant alpha-synuclein deposition which correlates with disease duration. Damage to these regions appears to impact on cognition, awareness and perception. These studies suggest that direct thalamic pathology contributes to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {While emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease, the impact of the microglia response in Alzheimer's disease remains a matter of debate. We aimed to study microglial activation in early Alzheimer's disease and its impact on clinical progression using a second-generation 18-kDa translocator protein positron emission tomography radiotracer together with amyloid imaging using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. We enrolled 96 subjects, 64 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 32 controls, from the IMABio3 study, who had both (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B and (18)F-DPA-714 positron emission tomography imaging. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were classified as prodromal Alzheimer's disease (n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 26). Translocator protein-binding was measured using a simple ratio method with cerebellar grey matter as reference tissue, taking into account regional atrophy. Images were analysed at the regional (volume of interest) and at the voxel level. Translocator protein genotyping allowed the classification of all subjects in high, mixed and low affinity binders. Thirty high+mixed affinity binders patients with Alzheimer's disease were dichotomized into slow decliners (n = 10) or fast decliners (n = 20) after 2 years of follow-up. All patients with Alzheimer's disease had an amyloid positive Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. Among controls, eight had positive amyloid scans (n = 6 high+mixed affinity binders), defined as amyloidosis controls, and were analysed separately. By both volumes of interest and voxel-wise comparison, 18-kDa translocator protein-binding was higher in high affinity binders, mixed affinity binders and high+mixed affinity binders Alzheimer's disease groups compared to controls, especially at the prodromal stage, involving the temporo-parietal cortex. Translocator protein-binding was positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores and grey matter volume, as well as with Pittsburgh compound B binding. Amyloidosis controls displayed higher translocator protein-binding than controls, especially in the frontal cortex. We found higher translocator protein-binding in slow decliners than fast decliners, with no difference in Pittsburgh compound B binding. Microglial activation appears at the prodromal and possibly at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, and seems to play a protective role in the clinical progression of the disease at these early stages. The extent of microglial activation appears to differ between patients, and could explain the overlap in translocator protein binding values between patients with Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis controls.},

abstract = {Probabilistic atlases of neuroanatomy are more representative of population anatomy than single brain atlases. They allow anatomical labeling of the results of group studies in stereotaxic space, automated anatomical labeling of individual brain imaging datasets, and the statistical assessment of normal ranges for structure volumes and extents. No such manually constructed atlas is currently available for the frequently studied group of young adults. We studied 20 normal subjects (10 women, median age 31 years) with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Images were nonuniformity corrected and reoriented along both the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line horizontally and the midsagittal plane sagittally. Building on our previous work, we have expanded and refined existing algorithms for the subdivision of MRI datasets into anatomical structures. The resulting algorithm is presented in the Appendix. Forty-nine structures were interactively defined as three-dimensional volumes-of-interest (VOIs). The resulting 20 individual atlases were spatially transformed (normalized) into standard stereotaxic space, using SPM99 software and the MNI/ICBM 152 template. We evaluated volume data for all structures both in native space and after spatial normalization, and used the normalized superimposed atlases to create a maximum probability map in stereotaxic space, which retains quantitative information regarding inter-subject variability. Its potential applications range from the automatic labeling of new scans to the detection of anatomical abnormalities in patients. Further data can be extracted from the atlas for the detailed analysis of individual structures.},

abstract = {Post-mortem analyses of brains from patients with Parkinson disease who received fetal mesencephalic transplants show that $\alpha$-synuclein-containing ($\alpha$-syn-containing) Lewy bodies gradually appear in grafted neurons. Here, we explored whether intercellular transfer of $\alpha$-syn from host to graft, followed by seeding of $\alpha$-syn aggregation in recipient neurons, can contribute to this phenomenon. We assessed $\alpha$-syn cell-to-cell transfer using microscopy, flow cytometry, and high-content screening in several coculture model systems. Coculturing cells engineered to express either GFP- or DsRed-tagged $\alpha$-syn resulted in a gradual increase in double-labeled cells. Importantly, $\alpha$-syn-GFP derived from 1 neuroblastoma cell line localized to red fluorescent aggregates in other cells expressing DsRed-$\alpha$-syn, suggesting a seeding effect of transmitted $\alpha$-syn. Extracellular $\alpha$-syn was taken up by cells through endocytosis and interacted with intracellular $\alpha$-syn. Next, following intracortical injection of recombinant $\alpha$-syn in rats, we found neuronal uptake was attenuated by coinjection of an endocytosis inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrated in vivo transfer of $\alpha$-syn between host cells and grafted dopaminergic neurons in mice overexpressing human $\alpha$-syn. In summary, intercellularly transferred $\alpha$-syn interacts with cytoplasmic $\alpha$-syn and can propagate $\alpha$-syn pathology. These results suggest that $\alpha$-syn propagation is a key element in the progression of Parkinson disease pathology.},

abstract = {Proliferation and activation of microglia in the brain, concentrated around amyloid plaques, is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human genetics data point to a key role for microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The majority of risk genes for AD are highly expressed (and many are selectively expressed) by microglia in the brain. There is mounting evidence that microglia protect against the incidence of AD, as impaired microglial activities and altered microglial responses to $\beta$-amyloid are associated with increased AD risk. On the other hand, there is also abundant evidence that activated microglia can be harmful to neurons. Microglia can mediate synapse loss by engulfment of synapses, likely via a complement-dependent mechanism; they can also exacerbate tau pathology and secrete inflammatory factors that can injure neurons directly or via activation of neurotoxic astrocytes. Gene expression profiles indicate multiple states of microglial activation in neurodegenerative disease settings, which might explain the disparate roles of microglia in the development and progression of AD pathology.},

abstract = {Loci underlying autosomal dominant forms of most neurodegenerative disease have been identified: prion mutations cause Gerstmann Straussler syndrome and hereditary Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, tau mutations cause autosomal dominant frontal temporal dementia and $\alpha$-synuclein mutations cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. In these cases, the pathogenic mutation is in the protein that is deposited in the diseased tissue and the whole protein is deposited. In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in amyloid precursor protein or in the presenilins cause autosomal dominant disease. These are the substrate and proteases responsible for the production of the deposited peptide A$\beta$. Thus, in all the cases, the mutations lead to the disease by a mechanism that involves the deposition process. Furthermore, sporadic forms of all these diseases are predisposed by genetic variability at the same loci, implying that the quantity of the normal protein influences the risk of this form of disease. These results show that the amount of pathogenic protein expression is a key factor in determining disease initiation. Recent work on transgenic models of these diseases is consistent with the view that there are two stages of pathogenesis: a concentration-dependent formation of a pathogenic protein oligomer followed by aggregation on to this oligomeric template by a process that is less dependent on the concentration of the protein.},

(A??) accumulation in many brain areas. Selective overexpression of mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) predominantly in layer II/III neurons of the EC caused cognitive and behavioral abnormalities characteristic of mouse models with widespread neuronal APP overexpression, including hyperactivity, disinhibition, and spatial learning and memory deficits. APP/A?? overexpression in the EC elicited abnormalities in synaptic functions and activity-related molecules in the dentate gyrus and CA1 and epileptiform activity in parietal cortex. Soluble A?? was observed in the dentate gyrus, and A?? deposits in the hippocampus were localized to perforant pathway terminal fields. Thus, APP/A?? expression in EC neurons causes transsynaptic deficits that could initiate the cortical-hippocampal network dysfunction in mouse models and human patients with AD. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Similarities in neocortical circuit organization across areas and species suggest a common strategy to process diverse types of information, including sensation from diverse modalities, motor control and higher cognitive processes. Cortical neurons belong to a small number of main classes. The properties of these classes, including their local and long-range connectivity, developmental history, gene expression, intrinsic physiology and in vivo activity patterns, are remarkably similar across areas. Each class contains subclasses; for a rapidly growing number of these, conserved patterns of input and output connections are also becoming evident. The ensemble of circuit connections constitutes a basic circuit pattern that appears to be repeated across neocortical areas, with area- and species-specific modifications. Such 'serially homologous' organization may adapt individual neocortical regions to the type of information each must process.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy. Methods: Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB] + , age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB + patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow-up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross-modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated. Results: Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or APOE. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow-up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid-negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau-PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

abstract = {Objectives: To determine the prevalence of dementia in people under the age of 65 in a large catchment area, and use these figures to estimate the number of younger people affected by dementia in the UK. Design: Epidemiological catchment area prevalence survey. Setting: The London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and Hillingdon with a total population of 567 500 people. Participants: All residents of the catchment area with dementia, where the illness began before the age of 65 years. Participants were notified to the study by medical and care professionals. The diagnosis and age of onset was established from all available health and social care records. In total, 227 people were identified, of whom 185 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having a dementia which started before their 65th birthday. Main outcome measures: Diagnosis of dementia and differential diagnosis of the cause of the dementia. Results: The prevalence of dementia in those aged 30-64 was 54.0 per 100 000 (95% CI 45.1 to 64.1 per 100 000). For those aged 45-64 years, the prevalence was 98.1 per 100 000 (95% CI 81.1 to 118.0 per 100 000). From the age of 35 onwards, the prevalence of dementia approximately doubled with each 5 year increase in age. Extrapolating these figures nationally suggests that there are 18 319 (15 296-21 758) people with dementia under the age of 65 in the UK. Conclusions: The study confirms previous "guestimates" of the number of younger people affected by dementia in UK. The prevalence figures generated are robust, and are supported by other smaller and targeted prevalence surveys. The prevalence figures provided by this study will allow health planners to accurately estimate need and plan services.},

abstract = {Abnormal interactions and misfolding of synaptic proteins in the nervous system are being extensively explored as important pathogenic events resulting in neurodegeneration in various neurological disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In AD, misfolded amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, accumulates in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum and extracellularly as plaques. In contrast, in PD and DLB cases there is abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies, axons, and synapses. Furthermore, in DLB, Abeta 1-42 may promote alpha-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration. The central event leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in these diseases is not completely clear yet; however, recent advances in the field suggest that nerve damage might result from the conversion of nontoxic monomers to toxic oligomers and protofibrils. The mechanisms by which misfolded Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might lead to synapse loss are currently under investigation. Several lines of evidence support the possibility that Abeta peptide and alpha-synuclein might interact to cause mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage upon translocation of protofibrils to the membranes. Accumulation of Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane might result in the release of cytochrome C with the subsequent activation of the apoptosis cascade. Conversely, the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with AD and PD may also lead to increased membrane permeability and cytochrome C release, which promotes Abeta and alpha-synuclein oligomerization and neurodegeneration. Together, these studies suggest that the translocation of misfolded proteins to the mitochondrial membrane might play an important role in either triggering or perpetuating neurodegeneration. The insights obtained from the characterization of this process may be applied to the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in other neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. New evidence may also provide a rationale for the mitochondrial membrane as a target for therapy in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Neuroanatomically precise, genome-wide maps of transcript distributions are critical resources to complement genomic sequence data and to correlate functional and genetic brain architecture. Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topographythe closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown that cognitive and memory decline in this disease is accompanied by disrupted changes in the coordination of large-scale brain functional networks. However, alterations in coordinated patterns of structural brain networks in AD are still poorly understood. Here, we used cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging to investigate large-scale structural brain networks in 92 AD patients and 97 normal controls. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 54 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with controls, AD patients showed decreased cortical thickness intercorrelations between the bilateral parietal regions and increased intercorrelations in several selective regions involving the lateral temporal and parietal cortex as well as the cingulate and medial frontal cortex regions. Specially, AD patients showed abnormal small-world architecture in the structural cortical networks (increased clustering and shortest paths linking individual regions), implying a less optimal topological organization in AD. Moreover, AD patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality predominantly in the temporal and parietal heteromodal association cortex regions and increased nodal centrality in the occipital cortex regions. Finally, the brain networks of AD were about equally as robust to random failures as those of controls, but more vulnerable against targeted attacks, presumably because of the effects of pathological topological organization. Our findings suggest that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in AD patients, thus providing structural evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition. This work has implications for our understanding of how functional deficits in patients are associated with their underlying structural (morphological) basis.},

Although equal ratios of tau isoforms with 3 (3R) and 4 (4R) microtubule-binding repeats are expressed in the adult human brain, the pathological tau from different tauopathies have distinct isoform compositions and cell type specificities. The underlying mechanisms of tauopathies are unknown, partially due to the lack of proper models. Here, we generate a new transgenic mouse line expressing equal ratios of 3R and 4R human tau isoforms (6hTau mice). Intracerebral injections of distinct human tauopathy brain-derived tau strains into 6hTau mice recapitulate the deposition of pathological tau with distinct tau isoform compositions and cell type specificities as in human tauopathies. Moreover, through in vivo propagation of these tau strains among different mouse lines, we demonstrate that the transmission of distinct tau strains is independent of strain isoform compositions, but instead intrinsic to unique pathological conformations.},

abstract = {Type III RNase Dicer is responsible for the maturation and function of microRNA (miRNA) molecules in the cell. It is now well-documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in neuronal death, particularly in the adult brain, remain poorly defined. Here we show that the absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype. Although neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology. Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo. We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo. Finally, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In summary, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by striatal dopamine depletion, especially in the posterior putamen. The dense connectivity profile of the striatum suggests that these local impairments may propagate throughout the whole cortico-striatal network. Here we test the effect of striatal dopamine depletion on cortico-striatal network properties by comparing the functional connectivity profile of the posterior putamen, the anterior putamen, and the caudate nucleus between 41 PD patients and 36 matched controls. We used multiple regression analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to quantify functional connectivity across different networks. Each region had a distinct connectivity profile that was similarly expressed in patients and controls: the posterior putamen was uniquely coupled to cortical motor areas, the anterior putamen to the pre-supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate cortex, and the caudate nucleus to the dorsal prefrontal cortex. Differences between groups were specific to the putamen: although PD patients showed decreased coupling between the posterior putamen and the inferior parietal cortex, this region showed increased functional connectivity with the anterior putamen. We conclude that dopamine depletion in PD leads to a remapping of cerebral connectivity that reduces the spatial segregation between different cortico-striatal loops. These alterations of network properties may underlie abnormal sensorimotor integration in PD.},

abstract = {How are neurons distributed along the cortical surface and across functional areas? Here we use the isotropic fractionator (Herculano-Houzel and Lent, 2005) to analyze the distribution of neurons across the entire isocortex of the mouse, divided into 18 functional areas defined anatomically. We find that the number of neurons underneath a surface area (the N/A ratio) varies 4.5-fold across functional areas and neuronal density varies 3.2-fold. The face area of S1 contains the most neurons, followed by motor cortex and the primary visual cortex. Remarkably, while the distribution of neurons across functional areas does not accompany the distribution of surface area, it mirrors closely the distribution of cortical volumes-with the exception of the visual areas, which hold more neurons than expected for their volume. Across the non-visual cortex, the volume of individual functional areas is a shared linear function of their number of neurons, while in the visual areas, neuronal densities are much higher than in all other areas. In contrast, the 18 functional areas cluster into three different zones according to the relationship between the N/A ratio and cortical thickness and neuronal density: these three clusters can be called visual, sensory, and, possibly, associative. These findings are remarkably similar to those in the human cerebral cortex (Ribeiro et al., 2013) and suggest that, like the human cerebral cortex, the mouse cerebral cortex comprises two zones that differ in how neurons form the cortical volume, and three zones that differ in how neurons are distributed underneath the cortical surface, possibly in relation to local differences in connectivity through the white matter. Our results suggest that beyond the developmental divide into visual and non-visual cortex, functional areas initially share a common distribution of neurons along the parenchyma that become delimited into functional areas according to the pattern of connectivity established later.},

abstract = {XNAT Central is a publicly accessible medical imaging data repository based on the XNAT open-source imaging informatics platform. It hosts a wide variety of research imaging data sets. The primary motivation for creating XNAT Central was to provide a central repository to host and provide access to a wide variety of neuroimaging data. In this capacity, XNAT Central hosts a number of data sets from research labs and investigative efforts from around the world, including the OASIS Brains imaging studies, the NUSDAST study of schizophrenia, and more. Over time, XNAT Central has expanded to include imaging data from many different fields of research, including oncology, orthopedics, cardiology, and animal studies, but continues to emphasize neuroimaging data. Through the use of XNAT's DICOM metadata extraction capabilities, XNAT Central provides a searchable repository of imaging data that can be referenced by groups, labs, or individuals working in many different areas of research. The future development of XNAT Central will be geared towards greater ease of use as a reference library of heterogeneous neuroimaging data and associated synthetic data. It will also become a tool for making data available supporting published research and academic articles.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) accurately delineates white matter pathways when the Gaussian model of diffusion is valid. However, DTI yields erroneous results when diffusion takes on a more complex distribution, as is the case in the brain when fiber tracts cross. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) overcomes this limitation of DTI by more fully characterizing the angular dependence of intravoxel diffusion. Among the various HARDI methods that have been proposed, QBI offers advantages such as linearity, model independence, and relatively easy implementation. In this work, reconstruction of the q-ball orientation distribution function (ODF) is reformulated in terms of spherical harmonic basis functions, yielding an analytic solution with useful properties of a frequency domain representation. The harmonic basis is parsimonious for typical b-values, which enables the ODF to be synthesized from a relatively small number of noisy measurements and thus brings the technique closer to clinical feasibility from the standpoint of total imaging time. The proposed method is assessed using Monte Carlo computer simulations and compared with conventional q-ball reconstruction using spherical RBFs. In vivo results from 3T whole-brain HARDI of adult volunteers are also provided to verify the underlying mathematical theory.},

abstract = {The prediction of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically relevant, and may above all have a significant impact on accelerating the development of new treatments. In this paper, we present a new MRI-based biomarker that enables us to accurately predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD. In order to better capture the AD signature, we introduce two main contributions. First, we present a new graph-based grading framework to combine inter-subject similarity features and intra-subject variability features. This framework involves patch-based grading of anatomical structures and graph-based modeling of structure alteration relationships. Second, we propose an innovative multiscale brain analysis to capture alterations caused by AD at different anatomical levels. Based on a cascade of classifiers, this multiscale approach enables the analysis of alterations of whole brain structures and hippocampus subfields at the same time. During our experiments using the ADNI-1 dataset, the proposed multiscale graph-based grading method obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81% to predict conversion of MCI subjects to AD within three years. Moreover, when combined with cognitive scores, the proposed method obtained 85% of AUC. These results are competitive in comparison to state-of-the-art methods evaluated on the same dataset.},

@article{Heurtaux2010,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of extracellular deposits referred to beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) complexes or senile plaques. A$\beta$ peptide is firstly produced as monomers, readily aggregating to form multimeric complexes, of which the smallest aggregates are known to be the most neurotoxic. In AD patients, abundant reactive microglia migrate to and surround the A$\beta$ plaques. Though it is well known that microglia are activated by A$\beta$, little is known about the peptide conformation and the signaling cascades responsible for this activation. In this study, we have stimulated murine microglia with different A$\beta$(1-42) forms, inducing an inflammatory state, which was peptide conformation-dependent. The lightest oligomeric forms induced a more violent inflammatory response, whereas the heaviest oligomers and the fibrillar conformation were less potent inducers. BocMLF, a formylpeptide chemotactic receptor 2 antagonist, decreased the oligomeric A$\beta$-induced inflammatory response. The A$\beta$-induced signal transduction was found to depend on phosphorylation mechanisms mediated by MAPKs and on activator protein 1/nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells pathways activation. These results suggest that the reactive microgliosis intensity during AD might depend on the disease progression and consequently on the A$\beta$ conformation production. The recognition of A$\beta$ by the formylpeptide chemotactic receptor 2 seems to be a starting point of the signaling cascade inducing an inflammatory state. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.},

Backpropagation was the first computationally efficient model of how neural networks could learn multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled training data and it did not work well in deep networks. The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain top-down connections and training them to generate sensory data rather than to classify it. Learning multilayer generative models might seem difficult, but a recent discovery makes it easy to learn nonlinear distributed representations one layer at a time.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED The purpose of this study was to confirm with pathologic verification 2 beliefs related to Alzheimer's disease (AD): (a) the long-standing impression that bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism, as noted on FDG PET imaging, is the metabolic abnormality associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and (b) that the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the metabolic pattern of bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism allows differentiation between other degenerative causes of dementia. METHODS Twenty two individuals (8 women, 14 men) with difficult-to-characterize memory loss or dementia (using standard clinical criteria), and who eventually received pathologic confirmation of diagnosis, were evaluated. FDG PET brain scans were obtained and visually graded by an experienced nuclear medicine physician as to the presence of classic bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism as seen in Alzheimer's type dementia. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the metabolic pattern of bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism were determined using pathologic diagnosis as the gold standard. RESULTS The clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD was determined as the primary cause of dementia in 12 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis for probable AD were 63% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis for possible and probable AD were 75% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism being associated with AD were 93%, 63%, and 82%, respectively. CONCLUSION This study confirms that bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism is indeed the classic metabolic abnormality associated with AD. Furthermore, in individuals with dementia whose FDG PET scans indicated a metabolic pattern other than bilateral temporo-parietal hypometabolism, a cause of dementia other than AD should be suspected. These observations may be of clinical importance in differentiating dementia syndromes. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET are acceptable as tests to be used in the evaluation of dementia and particularly to confirm the clinical suspicion of AD.},

abstract = {Transcellular propagation of protein aggregates, or proteopathic seeds, may drive the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in a prion-like manner. In tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, this model predicts that tau seeds propagate pathology through the brain via cell-cell transfer in neural networks. The critical role of tau seeding activity is untested, however. It is unknown whether seeding anticipates and correlates with subsequent development of pathology as predicted for a causal agent. One major limitation has been the lack of a robust assay to measure proteopathic seeding activity in biological specimens. We engineered an ultrasensitive, specific, and facile FRET-based flow cytometry biosensor assay based on expression of tau or synuclein fusions to CFP and YFP, and confirmed its sensitivity and specificity to tau (∼ 300 fM) and synuclein (∼ 300 pM) fibrils. This assay readily discriminates Alzheimer's disease vs. Huntington's disease and aged control brains. We then carried out a detailed time-course study in P301S tauopathy mice, comparing seeding activity versus histological markers of tau pathology, including MC1, AT8, PG5, and Thioflavin S. We detected robust seeding activity at 1.5 mo, >1 mo before the earliest histopathological stain. Proteopathic tau seeding is thus an early and robust marker of tauopathy, suggesting a proximal role for tau seeds in neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its relationship with underlying $\beta$ amyloid deposition remains unclear. In vivo visualization of microglial activation has become possible with the development of molecular imaging ligands when used with positron emission tomography (PET). The translocator protein (TSPO) is upregulated during neuroinflammation. Consequently, targeting TSPO with radiolabeled ligands for PET is an attractive biomarker for neuroinflammation. METHODS: A review of the research literature on PET imaging which studied in vivo neuroinflammation in AD subjects and its relationship with amyloid load was performed, including papers published between 2001 and 2012. RESULTS: Six studies were included using either [(11)C]PK-11195 or another non-TSPO radioligand that binds to the monoaminooxidase B. All the studies evaluated amyloid load with [(11)C]PIB. Microglial activation and astrocytosis are potentially early phenomena in AD. However, the individual levels of amyloid deposition and microglial activation were not correlated. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging to visualize neuroinflammation in AD may contribute to our understanding of the kinetics of neuroinflammation and its relationship to the hallmarks of the disease. Both are important for the development of future therapeutic modalities and for quantifying the efficacy of future disease-modifying treatments.},

abstract = {Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers a cellular stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that protects the cell against the toxic buildup of misfolded proteins. Previously, we reported that UPR activation is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. How the UPR relates to the pathological hallmarks of AD is still elusive. In the present study, the involvement of UPR activation in neurofibrillary degeneration in AD was investigated. Immunoreactivity for the phosphorylated UPR activation markers pancreatic ER kinase (pPERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha was observed in hippocampal neurons associated with granulovacuolar degeneration. The percentage of pPERK-immunoreactive neurons was increased in AD cases compared with nondemented control cases and with the Braak stage for neurofibrillary changes. Although absent from neurofibrillary tangles, pPERK immunoreactivity was most abundant in neurons with diffuse localization of phosphorylated tau protein. Additional analyses showed that pPERK immunoreactivity was associated with ubiquitin and the ubiquitin binding protein p62. A strong co-occurrence of immunoreactivity for both pPERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta in neurons was also observed. Together, these data indicate that UPR activation in AD neurons occurs at an early stage of neurofibrillary degeneration and suggest that the prolonged activation of the UPR is involved in both tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration in AD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Misfolding of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) within neurons into neurofibrillary tangles is an important pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau pathology correlates with cognitive decline in AD and follows a stereotypical anatomical course; several recent studies indicate that tau pathology spreads inter-neuronally via misfolded tau "seeds." Previous research has focused on neurons as the source of these tau seeds. However, recent studies as well as the data contained herein suggest that microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a direct role in the spread of tau pathology. METHODS Primary adult microglia were isolated from human AD cases and the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model and used for analysis of gene expression, tau protein by Simoa technology, and quantification of tau seeding using a highly sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensing cell line for tau seeding and aggregation. RESULTS Here, we show that microglia isolated from both human tauopathy and AD cases and the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse model stably contain tau seeds, despite not synthesizing any tau. Microglia releases these tau seeds in vitro into their conditioned media (CM). This suggests that microglia have taken up tau but are incapable of entirely neutralizing its seeding activity. Indeed, when in vitro microglia are given media containing tau seeds, they reduce (but do not eliminate) tau seeding. When microglia are treated with inflammagens such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL1$\beta$), tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$), or amyloid-$\beta$, their ability to reduce tau seeding is unchanged and these factors do not induce seeding activity on their own. CONCLUSIONS Overall, these data suggest that microglia have a complex role: they are capable of taking up and breaking down seed competent tau, but do so inefficiently and could therefore potentially play a role in the spread of tau pathology.},

In the current study, we investigated the grey and white matter neural correlates of disinhibition in a sample of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 14) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 15). We employed an objective (Hayling Test of inhibitory functioning) and subjective/carer-based (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) measure of disinhibition to reveal convergent evidence of disinhibitory behaviour. Mean and overlap-based statistical analyses were conducted to investigate profiles of performance in patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and controls. Hayling Test and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were entered as covariates in a grey matter voxel-based morphometry, as well as in a white matter diffusion tensor imaging analysis to determine the underlying grey and white matter correlates. Patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more disinhibition on both behavioural measures in comparison to patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls. Voxel-based morphometry results revealed that atrophy in orbitofrontal/subgenual, medial prefrontal cortex and anterior temporal lobe areas covaried with total errors score of the Hayling Test. Similarly, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory disinhibition frequency score correlated with atrophy in orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole brain regions. The orbitofrontal atrophy related to the objective (Hayling Test) and subjective (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) measures of disinhibition was partially overlapping. Diffusion tensor imaging analysis revealed that white matter integrity fractional anisotropy values of the white matter tracts connecting the identified grey matter regions, namely uncinate fasciculus, forceps minor and genu of the corpus callosum, correlated well with the total error score of the Hayling Test. Our results show that a network of orbitofrontal, anterior temporal and mesial frontal brain regions and their connecting white matter tracts are involved in inhibitory functioning. Further, we find convergent evidence for objective and subjective disinhibition measures that the orbitofrontal/subgenual brain region is critical for adapting and maintaining normal behaviour.},

abstract = {A PET tracer is desired to help guide the discovery and development of disease-modifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the predominant tau pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD). We describe the preclinical characterization of the NFT PET tracer 18F-MK-6240. METHODS In vitro binding studies were conducted with 3H-MK-6240 in tissue slices and homogenates from cognitively normal and AD human brain donors to evaluate tracer affinity and selectivity for NFTs. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated tau was performed on human brain slices for comparison with 3H-MK-6240 binding patterns on adjacent brain slices. PET studies were performed with 18F-MK-6240 in monkeys to evaluate tracer kinetics and distribution in the brain. 18F-MK-6240 monkey PET studies were conducted after dosing with unlabeled MK-6240 to evaluate tracer binding selectivity in vivo. RESULTS The 3H-MK-6240 binding pattern was consistent with the distribution of phosphorylated tau in human AD brain slices. 3H-MK-6240 bound with high affinity to human AD brain cortex homogenates containing abundant NFTs but bound poorly to amyloid plaque-rich, NFT-poor AD brain homogenates. 3H-MK-6240 showed no displaceable binding in the subcortical regions of human AD brain slices and in the hippocampus/entorhinal cortex of non-AD human brain homogenates. In monkey PET studies, 18F-MK-6240 displayed rapid and homogeneous distribution in the brain. The 18F-MK-6240 volume of distribution stabilized rapidly, indicating favorable tracer kinetics. No displaceable binding was observed in self-block studies in rhesus monkeys, which do not natively express NFTs. Moderate defluorination was observed as skull uptake. CONCLUSION 18F-MK-6240 is a promising PET tracer for the in vivo quantification of NFTs in AD patients.},

In this paper, we propose a diffusion model with impulsive sources over the brain connectivity network to model the progression of brain atrophy. To reliably estimate the atrophy sources, we impose sparse regularization on the source distribution and solve the inverse problem with an efficient gradient descent method. We localize the possible origins of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on a large set of repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The distribution of the sources averaged over the sample population is evaluated. We find that the dementia sources have different concentrations in the brain lobes for AD patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, indicating possible switch of the dementia driving mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate that we can effectively predict changes of brain atrophy patterns with the proposed model.

METHODS: We enrolled 26 nondemented PD subjects and 12 control subjects. All subjects underwent [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging, and a complete neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: FDG-PET of subjects with PD revealed significant metabolic elevations in the bilateral posterior lentiform nucleus, posterior cingulate, and parahippocampus, and metabolic reductions in the bilateral temporoparietal association cortex and occipital lobe versus controls. PD subjects had significant reductions in executive/attention function, memory/verbal learning, and speed of thinking, and significantly increased depression, anxiety and apathy scores compared with controls. Motor dysfunction correlated with increased metabolism in the posterior lentiform nucleus, pons, and cerebellum, and decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal lobe. Cognitive dysfunction correlated with increased posterior cingulate metabolism and decreased temporoparietal lobe metabolism. Depressive symptoms correlated with increased amygdala metabolism; anxiety scores correlated with decreased caudate metabolism, and apathy scores correlated with increased metabolism in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal lobe and decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal association cortex.

abstract = {Accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of AD. Therefore, patients with MCI who are at high risk of fully developing AD should be identified to accurately predict AD. However, the relationship between brain images and AD is difficult to construct because of the complex characteristics of neuroimaging data. To address this problem, we present a longitudinal measurement of MCI brain images and a hierarchical classification method for AD prediction. Longitudinal images obtained from individuals with MCI were investigated to acquire important information on the longitudinal changes, which can be used to classify MCI subjects as either MCI conversion (MCIc) or MCI non-conversion (MCInc) individuals. Moreover, a hierarchical framework was introduced to the classifier to manage high feature dimensionality issues and incorporate spatial information for improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated using 131 patients with MCI (70 MCIc and 61 MCInc) based on MRI scans taken at different time points. Results showed that the proposed method achieved 79.4% accuracy for the classification of MCIc versus MCInc, thereby demonstrating very promising performance for AD prediction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia affects a large and growing number of older adults in the United States. The monetary costs attributable to dementia are likely to be similarly large and to continue to increase. METHODS: In a subsample (856 persons) of the population in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults, the diagnosis of dementia was determined with the use of a detailed in-home cognitive assessment that was 3 to 4 hours in duration and a review by an expert panel. We then imputed cognitive status to the full HRS sample (10,903 persons, 31,936 person-years) on the basis of measures of cognitive and functional status available for all HRS respondents, thereby identifying persons in the larger sample with a high probability of dementia. The market costs associated with care for persons with dementia were determined on the basis of self-reported out-of-pocket spending and the utilization of nursing home care; Medicare claims data were used to identify costs paid by Medicare. Hours of informal (unpaid) care were valued either as the cost of equivalent formal (paid) care or as the estimated wages forgone by informal caregivers. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of dementia among persons older than 70 years of age in the United States in 2010 was 14.7%. The yearly monetary cost per person that was attributable to dementia was either $56,290 (95% confidence interval [CI], $42,746 to $69,834) or $41,689 (95% CI, $31,017 to $52,362), depending on the method used to value informal care. These individual costs suggest that the total monetary cost of dementia in 2010 was between $157 billion and $215 billion. Medicare paid approximately $11 billion of this cost. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia represents a substantial financial burden on society, one that is similar to the financial burden of heart disease and cancer. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging.).},

abstract = {Senile plaques formed by $\beta$-amyloid peptides (A$\beta$) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein, are the hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to loss of neurons. While several transgenic (Tg) mouse models have recapitulated aspects of AD-like A$\beta$ and tau pathologies, a spatiotemporal mapping paradigm for progressive NFT accumulation is urgently needed to stage disease progression in AD mouse models. Braak and co-workers developed an effective and widely used NFT staging paradigm for human AD brains. The creation of a Braak-like spatiotemporal staging scheme for tau pathology in mouse models would facilitate mechanistic studies of AD-like tau pathology. Such a scheme would also enhance the reproducibility of preclinical AD therapeutic studies. Thus, we developed a novel murine model of A$\beta$ and tau pathologies and devised a spatiotemporal scheme to stage the emergence and accumulation of NFTs with advancing age. Notably, the development of NFTs followed a spatiotemporal Braak-like pattern similar to that observed in authentic AD. More significantly, the presence of A$\beta$ accelerated NFT formation and enhanced tau amyloidosis; however, tau pathology did not have the same effect on A$\beta$ pathology. This novel NFT staging scheme provides new insights into the mechanisms of tau pathobiology, and we speculate that this scheme will prove useful for other basic and translational studies of AD mouse models.

abstract = {Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathologies, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising filamentous tau protein. Although emerging evidence suggests that tau pathology may be transmitted, we demonstrate here that synthetic tau fibrils are sufficient to transmit tau inclusions in a mouse model. Specifically, intracerebral inoculation of young PS19 mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) with synthetic preformed fibrils (pffs) assembled from recombinant full-length tau or truncated tau containing four microtubule binding repeats resulted in rapid induction of NFT-like inclusions that propagated from injected sites to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, injection of tau pffs into either hippocampus or striatum together with overlaying cortex gave rise to distinct pattern of spreading. Moreover, unlike tau pathology that spontaneously develops in old PS19 mice, the pff-induced tau inclusions more closely resembled AD NFTs because they were Thioflavin S positive, acetylated, and more resistant to proteinase K digestion. Together, our study demonstrates that synthetic tau pffs alone are capable of inducing authentic NFT-like tau aggregates and initiating spreading of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model.},

abstract = {Filamentous tau inclusions are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative tauopathies. An increasing number of studies implicate the cell-to-cell propagation of tau pathology in the progression of tauopathies. We recently showed (Iba et al., J Neurosci 33:1024-1037, 2013) that inoculation of preformed synthetic tau fibrils (tau PFFs) into the hippocampus of young transgenic (Tg) mice (PS19) overexpressing human P301S mutant tau induced robust tau pathology in anatomically connected brain regions including the locus coeruleus (LC). Since Braak and colleagues hypothesized that the LC is the first brain structure to develop tau lesions and since LC has widespread connections throughout the CNS, LC neurons could be the critical initiators of the stereotypical spreading of tau pathology through connectome-dependent transmission of pathological tau in AD. Here, we report that injections of tau PFFs into the LC of PS19 mice induced propagation of tau pathology to major afferents and efferents of the LC. Notably, tau pathology propagated along LC efferent projections was localized not only to axon terminals but also to neuronal perikarya, suggesting transneuronal transfer of templated tau pathology to neurons receiving LC projections. Further, brainstem neurons giving rise to major LC afferents also developed perikaryal tau pathology. Surprisingly, while tangle-bearing neurons degenerated in the LC ipsilateral to the injection site starting 6 months post-injection, no neuron loss was seen in the contralateral LC wherein tangle-bearing neurons gradually cleared tau pathology by 6-12 months post-injection. However, the spreading pattern of tau pathology observed in our LC-injected mice is different from that in AD brains since hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which are affected in early stages of AD, were largely spared of tau inclusions in our model. Thus, while our study tested critical aspects of the Braak hypothesis of tau pathology spread, this novel mouse model provides unique opportunities to elucidate mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of neurons to acquire tau pathology and succumb to or resist tau-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Objective To determine whether the hypometabolism observed in PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is due entirely to brain atrophy. Background Reduced brain glucose metabolism in AD patients measured using PET has been reported by numerous authors. Actual glucose metabolic values in AD may be reduced artificially because of brain atrophy, which accentuates the partial volume effect (PVE) on data collected by PET. Methods Using segmented MR images, we corrected regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose for PVEs to evaluate the effect of atrophy on uncorrected values for brain metabolism in AD patients and healthy control subjects. Results Global glucose metabolism was reduced significantly before and after correction in AD patients compared with controls. Before PVE correction, glucose metabolic values in patients were lower than in control subjects in the inferior parietal, frontal, and lateral temporal cortex; in the posterior cingulate; and in the precuneus. These reductions remained significantly lower after PVE correction, although in the posterior cingulate the difference in metabolism between AD patients and control subjects lessened. Regional glucose metabolism of these areas with PVE correction was lower in moderately-severely demented patients than in mildly demented patients. Conclusion Reduced glucose metabolism measured by PET in AD is not simply an artifact due to an increase in CSF space induced by atrophy, but reflects a true metabolic reduction per gram of tissue.},

We aimed to investigate the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and white matter (WM) FA of central olfactory areas in early PD. Twenty-four patients at Hoehn and Yahr stages I and II and 24 healthy controls matched by age, gender and years of education participated in this study. DTI was acquired at a 3 Tesla scanner and odor identification was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We performed FA voxelwise group comparisons in the central olfactory structures using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and correlation analyses between FA values in these central olfactory areas and UPSIT scores. Patients with severe microsmia (UPSIT between 19 and 25) and anosmia (UPSIT lower or equal to 18) had lower FA values than PD patients with mild/moderate or no olfactory dysfunction (UPSIT between 26 and 40) and healthy controls in the WM adjacent to gyrus rectus. In addition, patients with anosmia had reduced FA in the WM surrounding primary olfactory areas in comparison with healthy controls. FA values in the WM adjacent to primary olfactory cortex and right gyrus rectus correlated with UPSIT scores in the PD group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that microstructural WM reductions are present in the central olfactory system of early stage PD patients and that these reductions are associated with reduced ability to smell.},

abstract = {Missense mutations of the tau gene cause autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), an illness characterized by progressive personality changes, dementia, and parkinsonism. There is prominent frontotemporal lobe atrophy of the brain accompanied by abundant tau accumulation with neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal cell loss. Using a hamster prion protein gene expression vector, we generated several independent lines of transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the longest form of the human four-repeat tau with the R406W mutation associated with FTDP-17. The TgTauR406W 21807 line showed tau accumulation beginning in the hippocampus and amygdala at 6 months of age, which subsequently spread to the cortices and subcortical areas. The accumulated tau was phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, conformationally changed, argyrophilic, and sarcosyl-insoluble. Activation of GSK-3beta and astrocytic induction of mouse tau were observed. Astrogliosis and microgliosis correlated with prominent tau accumulation. Electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of straight filaments. Behavioral tests showed motor disturbances and progressive acquired memory loss between 10 to 12 months of age. These findings suggested that TgTauR406W mice would be a useful model in the study of frontotemporal dementia and other tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

abstract = {The nonhuman primate entorhinal cortex is the primary interface for information flow between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. Based on previous retrograde tracer studies, neocortical afferents to the macaque monkey entorhinal cortex originate largely in polysensory cortical association areas. However, the topographical and laminar distributions of cortical inputs to the entorhinal cortex have not yet been comprehensively described. The present study examines the regional and laminar termination of projections within the entorhinal cortex arising from different cortical areas. The study is based on a library of 51 (3)H-amino acid injections that involve most of the afferent regions of the entorhinal cortex. The range of termination patterns was broad. Some areas, such as the medial portion of orbitofrontal area 13 and parahippocampal areas TF and TH, project widely within the entorhinal cortex. Other areas have a more focal and regionally selective termination. The lateral orbitofrontal, insular, anterior cingulate, and perirhinal cortices, for example, project only to rostral levels of the entorhinal cortex. The upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus projects mainly to intermediate levels of the entorhinal cortex, and the parietal and retrosplenial cortices project to caudal levels. The projections from some of these cortical regions preferentially terminate in the superficial layers (I-III) of the entorhinal cortex, whereas others project more heavily to the deep layers (V-VI). Thus, some of the cortical inputs may be more influential on the cortically directed outputs of the hippocampal formation or on gating neocortical information flow into the other fields of the hippocampal formation rather than contributing to the perforant path inputs to other hippocampal fields.},

abstract = {The role of microglia in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is unknown. To address this issue we examined 10 cases of PSP, 5 cases of CBD, and 4 normal controls. Microglial and tau burdens were determined with image analysis on brain sections that had been immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR and phospho-tau. We found that microglial activation was greater in PSP and CBD than normal controls, and that the microglial burden correlated with the tau burden in most areas. There were distinct patterns of microglial activation and tau pathology in PSP and CBD, with PSP showing more pathology in infratentorial structures and CBD showing more pathology in supratentorial structures. These results support the notion that PSP and CBD are distinct clinicopathologic entities. Microglial activation was not well correlated with tau pathology in the brainstem of PSP, which suggests that brainstem pathology in PSP is not exclusively due to tau pathology. While the results do not necessarily support a direct causal link between microglial activation and neurodegeneration in PSP or CBD, they nevertheless suggest that microglia play a role in disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. It has emerged that Abeta toxicity is tau dependent, although mechanistically this link remains unclear. Here, we show that tau, known as axonal protein, has a dendritic function in postsynaptic targeting of the Src kinase Fyn, a substrate of which is the NMDA receptor (NR). Missorting of tau in transgenic mice expressing truncated tau (Deltatau) and absence of tau in tau(-/-) mice both disrupt postsynaptic targeting of Fyn. This uncouples NR-mediated excitotoxicity and hence mitigates Abeta toxicity. Deltatau expression and tau deficiency prevent memory deficits and improve survival in Abeta-forming APP23 mice, a model of AD. These deficits are also fully rescued with a peptide that uncouples the Fyn-mediated interaction of NR and PSD-95 in vivo. Our findings suggest that this dendritic role of tau confers Abeta toxicity at the postsynapse with direct implications for pathogenesis and treatment of AD.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ and tau are the two hallmark proteins in Alzheimer's disease. Although both amyloid-$\beta$ and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of amyloid-$\beta$. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-$\beta$ toxicity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Graph-based brain anatomical network analysis models the brain as a graph whose nodes represent structural/functional regions, whereas the links between them represent nervous fiber connections. Initial studies of brain anatomical networks using this approach were devoted to describe the key organizational principles of the normal brain, while current trends seem to be more focused on detecting network alterations associated to specific brain disorders. Anatomical networks reconstructed using diffusion-weighed magnetic resonance-imaging techniques can be particularly useful in predicting abnormal brain states in which the white matter structure and, subsequently, the interconnections between gray matter regions are altered (e.g., due to the presence of diseases such as schizophrenia, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and dementia). This article offers an overview from early gross connectional anatomy explorations until more recent advances on anatomical brain network reconstruction approaches, with a specific focus on how the latter move toward the prediction of abnormal brain states. While anatomical graph-based predictor approaches are still at an early stage, they bear promising implications for individualized clinical diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as for neurodevelopmental evaluations and subsequent assisted creation of educational strategies related to specific cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {Generative models focused on multifactorial causal mechanisms in brain disorders are scarce and generally based on limited data. Despite the biological importance of the multiple interacting processes, their effects remain poorly characterized from an integrative analytic perspective. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal multifactorial causal model (MCM) of brain (dis)organization and therapeutic intervention that accounts for local causal interactions, effects propagation via physical brain networks, cognitive alterations, and identification of optimum therapeutic interventions. In this article, we focus on describing the model and applying it at the population-based level for studying late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). By interrelating six different neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measurements, this model accurately predicts spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) burden, glucose metabolism, vascular flow, resting state functional activity, structural properties, and cognitive integrity. The results suggest that a vascular dysregulation may be the most-likely initial pathologic event leading to LOAD. Nevertheless, they also suggest that LOAD it is not caused by a unique dominant biological factor (e.g. vascular or A$\beta$) but by the complex interplay among multiple relevant direct interactions. Furthermore, using theoretical control analysis of the identified population-based multifactorial causal network, we show the crucial advantage of using combinatorial over single-target treatments, explain why one-target A$\beta$ based therapies might fail to improve clinical outcomes, and propose an efficiency ranking of possible LOAD interventions. Although still requiring further validation at the individual level, this work presents the first analytic framework for dynamic multifactorial brain (dis)organization that may explain both the pathologic evolution of progressive neurological disorders and operationalize the influence of multiple interventional strategies.},

abstract = {Misfolded proteins (MP) are a key component in aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. For example, misfolded Amyloid-{\ss} (A{\ss}) and tau proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms underlying intra-brain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially uncharacterized. Here, is introduced an epidemic spreading model (ESM) for MP dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the brain's clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces advanced A{\ss} deposition patterns in the human brain (explaining 46∼56% of the variance in regional A{\ss} loads, in 733 subjects from the ADNI database). Furthermore, this model strongly supports a) the leading role of A{\ss} clearance deficiency and early A{\ss} onset age during Alzheimer's disease progression, b) that effective anatomical distance from A{\ss} outbreak region explains regional A{\ss} arrival time and A{\ss} deposition likelihood, c) the multi-factorial impact of APOE e4 genotype, gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain A{\ss} propagation, and d) the modulatory impact of A{\ss} propagation history on tau proteins concentrations, supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway between A{\ss} pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge, the ESM is the first computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain networks, production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated intercellular transfer mechanisms, individual genetic/demographic properties and clinical states in health and disease. In sum, the proposed ESM constitutes a promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {Our goal is to study the human brain anatomical network. For this, the anatomical connection probabilities (ACP) between 90 cortical and subcortical brain gray matter areas are estimated from diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) techniques. The ACP between any two areas gives the probability that those areas are connected at least by a single nervous fiber. Then, the brain is modeled as a non-directed weighted graph with continuous arc weights given by the ACP matrix. Based on this approach, complex networks properties such as small-world attributes, efficiency, degree distribution, vulnerability, betweenness centrality and motifs composition are studied. The analysis was carried out for 20 right-handed healthy subjects (mean age: 31.10, S.D.: 7.43). According to the results, all networks have small-world and broad-scale characteristics. Additionally, human brain anatomical networks present bigger local efficiency and smaller global efficiency than the corresponding random networks. In a vulnerability and betweenness centrality analysis, the most indispensable and critical anatomical areas were identified: putamens, precuneus, insulas, superior parietals and superior frontals. Interestingly, some areas have a negative vulnerability (e.g. superior temporal poles, pallidums, supramarginals and hechls), which suggest that even at the cost of losing in global anatomical efficiency, these structures were maintained through the evolutionary processes due to their important functions. Finally, symmetrical characteristic building blocks (motifs) of size 3 and 4 were calculated, obtaining that motifs of size 4 are the expanded version of motif of size 3. These results are in agreement with previous anatomical studies in the cat and macaque cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested if rates of brain atrophy accelerate in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) as they progress to typical late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). We included comparisons to subjects with aMCI who did not progress (labeled aMCI-S) and also to cognitively normal elderly subjects (CN). METHODS: We studied 46 subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD (labeled aMCI-P), 46 CN, and 23 aMCI-S. All subjects must have had three or more serial MRI scans. Rates of brain shrinkage and ventricular expansion were measured across all available serial MRI scans in each subject. Change in volumes relative to the point at which subjects progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD (the index date) was modeled in aMCI-P. Change in volumes relative to age was modeled in all three clinical groups. RESULTS: In aMCI-P the change in pre to post index rate (i.e., acceleration) of ventricular expansion was 1.7 cm(3)/year, and acceleration in brain shrinkage was 5.3 cm(3)/year. Brain volume declined and ventricular volume increased in all three groups with age. Volume changes decelerated with increasing age in aMCI-P, and to a lesser extent in aMCI-S, but were linear in the matched CN. Among all subjects with aMCI, rates of atrophy were greater in apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 carriers than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of atrophy accelerate as individuals progress from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to typical late onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Rates of atrophy are greater in younger than older subjects with aMCI who progressed to AD and subjects with aMCI who did not progress. We did not find that atrophy rates varied with age in 70- to 90-year-old cognitively normal subjects.},

abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a “research framework” because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of $\beta$ amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications that guided protocol development. A major effort was devoted to evaluating 3D T(1)-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B(1)-calibration scans when applicable; and an axial proton density-T(2) dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressing disorder in which pathophysiological abnormalities, detect-able in vivo by biomarkers, precede overt clinical symptoms by many years to decades. Five AD biomarkers are sufficiently validated to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic criteria and commonly used in therapeutic trials. Current AD biomarkers fall into two categories: biomarkers of amyloid-b plaques and of tau-related neurodegeneration. Three of the five are imaging measures and two are cerebrospinal fluid analytes. AD biomarkers do not evolve in an identical manner but rather in a sequential but temporally overlapping manner. Models of the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers can take the form of plots of biomarker severity (degree of abnormality) versus time. In this Review, we discuss several time-dependent models of AD that take into consideration varying age of onset (early versus late) and the influence of aging and co-occurring brain pathologies that commonly arise in the elderly. Pathological Features of Alzheimer's Disease Two well-known abnormal protein aggregates characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologically (Hyman et al., 2012). The hallmarks of amyloid-b (Ab) deposits in AD are neuritic plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Neuritic plaques are extracellular and consist of a dense central fibrillar Ab core with inflammatory cells and dystrophic neurites in its periphery. CAA is also extracellular and consists of fibrillar Ab deposited in the wall of arterioles in both the leptomeninges and penetrating vessels (Johnson et al., 2007). The second major proteinopathy is aggregated tau, which are intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). NFTs follow a stereotypic topographic progression pattern, first appearing in the brainstem and transentorhinal area, then progressing to the hippocampus, to paralimbic and adjacent medial-basal temporal cortex, to cortical association areas, and last to primary sensory-motor and visual areas (Braak and Braak, 1991). Another important pathological feature is neurode-generation, which maps onto NFT distribution topographically (not onto b-amyloid distribution) and is characterized macro-scopically as atrophy and microscopically as loss of neurons and neuronal processes (Braak and Braak, 1994; Terry et al., 1991). Clinical-autopsy correlation studies demonstrate a much tighter correlation between NFT and cognitive impairment than between amyloid and cognitive impairment (Bennett et al., 2004; Dickson et al., 1995; G{\'{o}} mez-Isla et al., 1997; Ingelsson et al., 2004). The tightest correlation between cognitive impair-ment and various autopsy features of AD though seems to be with neurodegeneration (Savva et al., 2009), specifically synapse loss (Terry et al., 1991). Approximately 30% of cognitively normal elderly subjects have sufficient pathology to meet criteria for AD at autopsy (Knopman et al., 2003; Price and Morris, 1999); how-ever, absence of cognitive symptoms is rarely seen in individuals with severe NFT burden.},

abstract = {Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of Abeta plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain beta-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF Abeta(42) and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which Abeta biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity.},

abstract = {Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of A$\beta$ plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain $\beta$-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF A$\beta$ 42 and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which A$\beta$ biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use serial imaging to gain insight into the sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and the clinical features associated with this sequence. We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P <0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group (P <0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) <amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) <Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P = 0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42, P <0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P <0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures can discriminate between normal elderly control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) of moderate to advanced severity. In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects ( p < 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75 SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted, normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic degeneration in AD early in the disease process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To model the temporal trajectory of $\beta$-amyloid accumulation using serial amyloid PET imaging. METHODS: Participants, aged 70-92 years, were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (n = 246) or the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (n = 14). All underwent 2 or more serial amyloid PET examinations. There were 205 participants classified as cognitively normal and 55 as cognitively impaired (47 mild cognitive impairment and 8 Alzheimer dementia). We measured baseline amyloid PET-relative standardized uptake values (SUVR) and, for each participant, estimated a slope representing their annual amyloid accumulation rate. We then fit regression models to predict the rate of amyloid accumulation given baseline amyloid SUVR, and evaluated age, sex, clinical group, and APOE as covariates. Finally, we integrated the amyloid accumulation rate vs baseline amyloid PET SUVR association to an amyloid PET SUVR vs time association. RESULTS: Rates of amyloid accumulation were low at low baseline SUVR. Rates increased to a maximum at baseline SUVR around 2.0, above which rates declined-reaching zero at baseline SUVR above 2.7. The rate of amyloid accumulation as a function of baseline SUVR had an inverted U shape. Integration produced a sigmoid curve relating amyloid PET SUVR to time. The average estimated time required to travel from an SUVR of 1.5-2.5 is approximately 15 years. CONCLUSION: This roughly 15-year interval where the slope of the amyloid SUVR vs time curve is greatest and roughly linear represents a large therapeutic window for secondary preventive interventions.},

abstract = {Our objective was to compare different whole-brain and region-specific measurements of within-person change on serial tau PET and evaluate its utility for clinical trials. We studied 126 individuals: 59 cognitively unimpaired with normal amyloid, 37 cognitively unimpaired with abnormal amyloid, and 30 cognitively impaired with an amnestic phenotype and abnormal amyloid. All had baseline amyloid PET and two tau PET, MRI, and clinical assessments. We compared the topography across all cortical regions of interest of tau PET accumulation rates and the rates of four different whole-brain or region-specific meta-regions of interest among the three clinical groups. We computed sample size estimates for change in tau PET, cortical volume, and memory/mental status indices for use as outcome measures in clinical trials. The cognitively unimpaired normal amyloid group had no observable tau accumulation throughout the brain. Tau accumulation rates in cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid were low [0.006 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), 0.5%, per year] but greater than rates in the cognitively unimpaired normal amyloid group in the basal and mid-temporal, retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, and entorhinal regions of interest. Thus, the earliest elevation in accumulation rates was widespread and not confined to the entorhinal cortex. Tau accumulation rates in the cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid group were 0.053 SUVR (3%) per year and greater than rates in cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid in all cortical areas except medial temporal. Rates of accumulation in the four meta-regions of interest differed but only slightly from one another. Among all tau PET meta-regions of interest, sample size estimates were smallest for a temporal lobe composite within cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid and for the late Alzheimer's disease meta-region of interest within cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid. The ordering of the sample size estimates by outcome measure was MRI < tau PET < cognitive measures. At a group-wise level, observable rates of short-term serial tau accumulation were only seen in the presence of abnormal amyloid. As disease progressed to clinically symptomatic stages (cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid), observable rates of tau accumulation were seen uniformly throughout the brain providing evidence that tau does not accumulate in one area at a time or in start-stop, stepwise sequence. The information captured by rate measures in different meta-regions of interest, even those with little topographic overlap, was similar. The implication is that rate measurements from simple meta-regions of interest, without the need for Braak-like staging, may be sufficient to capture progressive within-person accumulation of pathologic tau. Tau PET SUVR measures should be an efficient outcome measure in disease-modifying clinical trials.},

abstract = {Biomarkers have become an essential component of Alzheimer disease (AD) research and because of the pervasiveness of AD pathology in the elderly, the same biomarkers are used in cognitive aging research. A number of current issues suggest that an unbiased descriptive classification scheme for these biomarkers would be useful. We propose the "A/T/N" system in which 7 major AD biomarkers are divided into 3 binary categories based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures. "A" refers to the value of a $\beta$-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF A$\beta$42); "T," the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and "N," biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Each biomarker category is rated as positive or negative. An individual score might appear as A+, or A/N-, etc. The A/T/N system includes the new modality tau PET. It is agnostic to the temporal ordering of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. It includes all individuals in any population regardless of the mix of biomarker findings and therefore is suited to population studies of cognitive aging. It does not specify disease labels and thus is not a diagnostic classification system. It is a descriptive system for categorizing multidomain biomarker findings at the individual person level in a format that is easy to understand and use. Given the present lack of consensus among AD specialists on terminology across the clinically normal to dementia spectrum, a biomarker classification scheme will have broadest acceptance if it is independent from any one clinically defined diagnostic scheme.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the selective targeting of specific brain regions by different neurodegenerative diseases is one of the most intriguing mysteries in medicine. For example, it is known that Alzheimer's disease primarily affects parts of the brain that play a role in memory, whereas Parkinson's disease predominantly affects parts of the brain that are involved in body movement. However, the reasons that other brain regions remain unaffected in these diseases are unknown. A better understanding of the phenomenon of selective vulnerability is required for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches that specifically protect affected neurons, thereby altering the disease course and preventing its progression. Prion diseases are a fascinating group of neurodegenerative diseases because they exhibit a wide phenotypic spectrum caused by different sequence perturbations in a single protein. The possible ways that mutations affecting this protein can cause several distinct neurodegenerative diseases are explored in this Review to highlight the complexity underlying selective vulnerability. The premise of this article is that selective vulnerability is determined by the interaction of specific protein conformers and region-specific microenvironments harboring unique combinations of subcellular components such as metals, chaperones and protein translation machinery. Given the abundance of potential contributory factors in the neurodegenerative process, a better understanding of how these factors interact will provide invaluable insight into disease mechanisms to guide therapeutic discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared the accuracy of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to the accuracy of clinical and pathologic diagnosis in dementia patients. METHODS: Forty-four individuals with dementia, cognitive impairment, or normal cognitive function underwent clinical initial evaluation (IE) and PET scanning and were followed up for approximately 4 years until a final evaluation (FE) and 5 years until death and autopsy. Clinical, pathologic, and imaging diagnoses were categorized as Alzheimer disease (AD) or not AD. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the IE for the pathologic diagnosis of AD was 0.76, and specificity was 0.58; PET had values of 0.84 and 0.74, and FE had values of 0.88 and 0.63. Positive predictive values for IE, PET, and FE were 0.70, 0.81, and 0.76. Negative predictive values were 0.65, 0.78, and 0.80. The diagnosis of AD was associated with a 70% probability of detecting AD pathology; with a positive PET scan this increased to 84%, and with a negative PET scan this decreased to 31%. A diagnosis of not AD at IE was associated with a 35% probability of AD pathology, increasing to 70% with a positive PET scan. CONCLUSIONS: As a diagnostic tool, PET is superior to a baseline clinical evaluation and similar to an evaluation performed 4 years later. Although the addition of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET to a clinical diagnosis provides useful information that can affect the likelihood of detecting Alzheimer disease pathology, the value of this technique in the current clinical environment with limited therapeutic options is likely to be modest.},

While the amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD posits an initiating role for the $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) protein, there is limited understanding of why A$\beta$ is deposited. A growing body of evidence based on in vitro, animal studies and human imaging work suggests that synaptic activity increases A$\beta$, which is deposited preferentially in multimodal brain regions that show continuous levels of heightened activation and plasticity across the lifespan. Imaging studies of people with genetic predispositions to AD are consistent with these findings, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural efficiency or cognitive reserve may diminish A$\beta$ deposition.

abstract = {Importance: There is an urgent need for inexpensive and minimally invasive blood biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) that could be used to detect early disease changes. Objective: To assess how early in the course of AD plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (P-tau217) start to change compared with levels of established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers of AD pathology. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included cognitively healthy control individuals (n = 225) and participants with subjective cognitive decline (n = 89) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 176) from the BioFINDER-2 study. Participants were enrolled at 2 different hospitals in Sweden from January 2017 to October 2019. All study participants underwent plasma P-tau217 assessments and tau- and amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-PET imaging. A subcohort of 111 participants had 2 or 3 tau-PET scans. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in plasma P-tau217 levels in preclinical and prodromal AD compared with changes in CSF P-tau217 and PET measures. Results: Of 490 participants, 251 were women (51.2%) and the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (13.1) years. Plasma P-tau217 levels were increased in cognitively unimpaired participants with abnormal A$\beta$-PET but normal tau-PET in the entorhinal cortex (A$\beta$-PET+/ tau-PET- group vs A$\beta$-PET-/ tau-PET- group: median, 2.2 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 1.5-2.9 pg/mL] vs 0.7 pg/mL [IQR, 0.3-1.4 pg/mL]). Most cognitively unimpaired participants who were discordant for plasma P-tau217 and tau-PET were positive for plasma P-tau217 and negative for tau-PET (P-tau217+/tau-PET-: 36 [94.7%]; P-tau217-/tau-PET+: 2 [5.3%]). Event-based modeling of cross-sectional data predicted that in cognitively unimpaired participants and in those with mild cognitive impairment, both plasma and CSF P-tau217 would change before the tau-PET signal in the entorhinal cortex, followed by more widespread cortical tau-PET changes. When testing the association with global A$\beta$ load in nonlinear spline models, both plasma and CSF P-tau217 were increased at lower A$\beta$-PET values compared with tau-PET measures. Among participants with normal baseline tau-PET, the rates of longitudinal increase in tau-PET in the entorhinal cortex were higher in those with abnormal plasma P-tau217 at baseline (median standardized uptake value ratio, 0.029 [IQR, -0.006 to 0.041] vs -0.001 [IQR, -0.021 to 0.020]; Mann-Whitney U, P =.02). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, plasma P-tau217 levels were increased during the early preclinical stages of AD when insoluble tau aggregates were not yet detectable by tau-PET. Plasma P-tau217 may hold promise as a biomarker for early AD brain pathology.},

We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87–0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94–0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort.

abstract = {Neuron–glia communication contributes to the fine-tuning of synaptic functions. Oligodendrocytes near synapses detect and respond to neuronal activity, but their role in synapse development and plasticity remains largely unexplored. We show that oligodendrocytes modulate neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals through secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Oligodendrocyte-derived BDNF functions via presynaptic tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to ensure fast, reliable neurotransmitter release and auditory transmission in the developing brain. In auditory brainstem slices from Bdnf+/– mice, reduction in endogenous BDNF significantly decreased vesicular glutamate release by reducing the readily releasable pool of glutamate vesicles, without altering presynaptic Ca2+ channel activation or release probability. Using conditional knockout mice, cell-specific ablation of BDNF in oligodendrocytes largely recapitulated this effect, which was recovered by BDNF or TrkB agonist application. This study highlights a novel function for oligodendrocytes in synaptic transmission and their potential role in the activity-dependent refinement of presynaptic properties.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with significant patient disability and costs to the healthcare system. It is questioned whether early treatment may improve outcomes and delay disability. Early treatment relies on early diagnosis, which can be difficult to achieve because the diagnosis of PD is based on motor symptoms, is clinical in nature, and is complicated by potential presentation of nonmotor symptoms prior to motor symptoms. Economic analyses demonstrate that treatments other than levodopa may be cost-effective. The lack of correlation between Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) outcomes and imaging studies of dopamine uptake may reflect the inappropriate selection of study end points, since activities of daily living scores may be more applicable than motor function scores. Levodopa, the standard therapy for motor control of PD and one of the most effective options, is associated with complications (a wearing-off effect) when used long term. Other therapies, including dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, may limit the rate of dyskinesia relative to levodopa-based regimens. It appears that early treatment with the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline (1 mg), as compared with late treatment, delays the onset of worsened UPDRS score, especially the nonmotor activities of daily living subscore.},

abstract = {Understanding the time-dependent changes of biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a key to assessing disease progression and measuring the outcomes of disease-modifying therapies. In this article, we validate an AD progression score model which uses multiple biomarkers to quantify the AD progression of subjects following 3 assumptions: (1) there is a unique disease progression for all subjects; (2) each subject has a different age of onset and rate of progression; and (3) each biomarker is sigmoidal as a function of disease progression. Fitting the parameters of this model is a challenging problem which we approach using an alternating least squares optimization algorithm. To validate this optimization scheme under realistic conditions, we use the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. With the help of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that most of the global parameters of the model are tightly estimated, thus enabling an ordering of the biomarkers that fit the model well, ordered as: the Rey auditory verbal learning test with 30 minutes delay, the sum of the 2 lateral hippocampal volumes divided by the intracranial volume, followed (by the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes score and the mini-mental state examination score) in no particular order and at last the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale.},

Despite clinical, genetic, and experimental differences, evidence increasingly indicates considerable overlap between synucleinopathies and tauopathies or other protein-misfolding diseases. Inclusions, characteristics of these disorders, also occurring in other neurodegenerative diseases, suggest interactions of pathological proteins engaging common downstream pathways. Novel findings that have shifted our understanding in the role of pathologic proteins in the pathogenesis of Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases have confirmed correlations/overlaps between these and other neurodegenerative disorders. The synergistic effects of $\alpha$-synuclein, hyperphosphorylated tau, amyloid-$\beta$, and other pathologic proteins, and the underlying molecular pathogenic mechanisms, including induction and spread of protein aggregates, are critically reviewed, suggesting a dualism or triad of neurodegeneration in protein-misfolding disorders, although the etiology of most of these processes is still mysterious.},

abstract = {The two most frequent synucleinopathies, Parkinson disease (PD) or brainstem predominant type of Lewy body disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are neurodegenerative multisystem disorders with widespread occurrence of alpha-synuclein containing deposits in the central, peripheral, and autonomic systems. For both Lewy body-related disorders staging/classification systems based on semiquantitative assessment of the distribution and progression pattern of alpha-synuclein pathology are used that are considered to be linked to clinical dysfunctions. In PD a six-stage system is suggested to indicate a predictable sequence of lesions with ascending progression from medullary and olfactory nuclei to the cortex, the first two presymptomatic stages related to incidental Lewy body disease, stages 3 and 4 presenting with motor symptoms and the last two (cortical) stages frequently associated with cognitive impairment. DLB, according to consensus pathologic guidelines, by semiquantitative scoring of alpha-synuclein pathology (Lewy body density and distribution) in specific brain regions, is distinguished into three phenotypes (brainstem, transitory/limbic and diffuse cortical), also considering concomitant Alzheimer-related pathology. Recent retrospective clinico-pathologic studies, although largely confirming the staging system, particularly for younger onset PD with long duration, have shown that between 6.3 and 43% of cases did not follow the proposed caudo-rostral progression pattern of alpha-synuclein pathology. In 7 to 8.3% of clinically manifested PD cases with synuclein inclusions in midbrain and cortex corresponding to LB stages 4-5 the medullary nuclei were spared, whereas mild parkinsonian symptoms were already observed in stages 2 and 3. There is considerable clinical and pathologic overlap between PD (with or without dementia) and DLB, corresponding to Braak LB stages 5 and 6, both frequently associated with variable Alzheimer-type pathology. Dementia often does not correlate with progressed stages of Lewy body pathology, but is related to concomitant Alzheimer lesions or mixed pathologies. There is no relationship between Braak LB stages and clinical severity of PD. Therefore, the predictive validity of this concept is doubtful, since in large unselected autopsy series 30 to 55% of elderly subjects with widespread alpha-synuclein pathology (Braak stages 5-6) revealed no definite neuropsychiatric symptoms or were not classifiable, indicating compensatory mechanisms of the brain. The causes and molecular basis of rather frequent deviations from the proposed caudo-rostral progression of alpha-synuclein pathology in PD, its relation to the onset of classical parkinsonian symptoms, the causes for the lack of definite clinical symptoms despite widespread alpha-synuclein pathology in the nervous system, their relations to Alzheimer-type lesions, and the pathophysiologic impact of both pathologies remain to be further elucidated.},

For technical reasons, the olfactory system was not studied. In all PD brains, alpha-synuclein-positive inclusions and neuronal losses were present in medullary and pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra, with additional lesions in amygdala (24%), allocortex (58%), cingulate area (34%), and isocortex (26.5%). All PD cases corresponded to pathology stage 4-6 suggested by Braak et al. (2003, Neurobiol Aging 24:197). In most cases of DLB, the distribution of alpha-synuclein pathology and neurodegeneration corresponded to stages 5 and 6 of PD pathology. The case with essential tremor and 48.2% of the AD cases showed no LB pathology; in the other AD brains alpha-synuclein-positive inclusions were seen in various brain areas. None of the controls showed LB pathology. Among 12 cases of incidental Lewy body disease (without clinical parkinsonian signs), 7 corresponded morphologically to PD stage 3 or 4. In further 6 AD cases, 2 with parkinsonian symptoms, considerable damage to locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, nucleus basalis and allocortex with preservation of the medullary nuclei was seen. The preliminary data largely confirm the Braak staging of brain pathology, although some of the clinical PD cases corresponded to stage 3 often considered as "preclinical". In addition, some cases without demonstrable involvement of medullary nuclei showed extensive PD-like pathology in other brain areas, suggesting deviation from the proposed stereotypic expansion pattern and that incidental LB pathology may affect solely the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra. Striking similarity of LB pathology between DLB and PD suggests close morphological relationship between both disorders. Widespread LB lesions occurred in many sporadic AD cases without parkinsonian symptoms, the pathogenesis and clinical impact of which are unclear. The relationship between AD and PD with particular reference to alpha-synuclein-positive lesions needs further elucidation [corrected].},

A retrospective hospital-based study of the relative prevalence of different disorders was performed in 1,110 consecutive autopsy cases of demented elderly in Vienna, Austria (66% females, MMSE <20; mean age 83.3 +/- 5.4 SD years). It assessed clinical, general autopsy data and neuropathology including immunohistochemistry. Neuropathologic diagnosis followed current consensus criteria. Four age groups (7-10th decade) were evaluated. In the total cohort AD pathology was seen in 82.9% ("pure" AD 42.9%; AD + other pathologies 39.9%), VD in 10.8% (mixed dementia, MIX, i.e. AD + vascular encephalopathy in 5.5%); other disorders in 5.7%, and negative pathology in 0.8%. The relative prevalence of AD increased from age 60 to 89 years and decreased slightly after age 90+, while "pure" VD diagnosed in the presence of vascular encephalopathy of different types with low neuritic AD pathology (Braak stages <3; mean 1.2-1.6) decreased progressively from age 60 to 90+; 85-95% of these patients had histories of diabetes, morphologic signs of hypertension, 65% myocardial infarction/cardiac decompensation, and 75% a history of stroke(s). Morphologic subtypes, subcortical arteriosclerotic (the most frequent), multi-infarct encephalopathy, and strategic infarct dementia showed no age-related differences. The relative prevalence of AD + Lewy pathology remained fairly constant with increasing age. Mixed dementia and AD with minor cerebrovascular lesions increased significantly with age, while other dementias decreased. This retrospective study using strict morphologic criteria confirmed increased prevalence of AD with age, but mild decline at age 90+, and progressive decline of VD, while AD + vascular pathologies including MIX showed considerable age-related increase, confirming that mixed pathologies account for most dementia cases in very old persons. A prospective clinicopathologic study in oldest-old subjects showed a significant increase in both AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but decrease in VD over age 85, while in a small group of old subjects CAA without considerable AD pathology may be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the regional distribution of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, alpha-synuclein (AS), and pathology in both disorders. The basal ganglia from 17 age-matched patients of PDD and DLB each were immunohistochemically examined with variable degrees of associated Alzheimer pathology using antibodies to Abeta, AS, and tau. DLB brains showed a significantly higher burden of (diffuse) amyloid plaques in the putamen and caudate nucleus and slightly more severe tau pathology than PDD brains despite similar neuritic Braak stages. Phases of Abeta development in DLB brains often, but inconsistently, correlated with both neuritic Braak stages and severity of striatal Abeta load, while these correlations were almost never seen in PDD cases with Alzheimer lesions. They also revealed a higher burden of AS-lesions (both Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) than PDD cases that commonly had a paucity of all three types of lesion. The globus pallidus was virtually spared in both phenotypes. Differences in AS and Abeta pathologies and much less of tau lesions in the striatum support a morphologic distinction between PDD and DLB, which may be of pathophysiologic importance, but the causes of these differences are unclear.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of presenile dementia. The aim of the current study was 2-fold: (a) to delineate the brain regions with reduction of glucose metabolism, and (b) to investigate the hemispheric asymmetry of glucose metabolism in FTD using (18)F-FDG PET. METHODS We compared the regional metabolic patterns on (18)F-FDG PET images obtained from 29 patients with FTD and 11 healthy subjects using a voxel-wise analysis (statistical parametric mapping [SPM]). The hemispheric asymmetry of glucose metabolism was computed based on 2 different measures: one (AI(ROI)) by counting the (18)F-FDG activity of each hemisphere on the normalized and spatially smoothed PET images and the other (AI(SPM)) by counting the number of voxels with significant hypometabolism based on SPM results. RESULTS Significant hypometabolism was identified in extensive prefrontal areas, cingulate gyri, anterior temporal regions, and the left inferior parietal lobule. Hypometabolism was also found in the bilateral insula and uncus, left putamen and globus pallidus, and medial thalamic structures. Frontal hypometabolism was more prominent in the left hemisphere than in the right. Twenty-six (90%) of the 29 patients with FTD had AI(ROI) values indicating significant lateralization of glucose metabolism; 18 patients had hypometabolism more severe on the left than right side, and only 8 patients had the opposite pattern. Results from AI(SPM) showed similar patterns. CONCLUSION The voxel-wise analysis of (18)F-FDG PET images of patients with FTD revealed hypometabolism in extensive cortical regions, such as frontal and anterior temporal areas, cingulate gyri, uncus, and insula and subcortical areas, including basal ganglia (putamen and globus pallidus) and medial thalamic regions. The hemispheric asymmetry of hypometabolism (more frequently lateralized to the left) was common in patients with FTD, which may be another metabolic feature that helps to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease or other causes of dementia.},

abstract = {A number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, Parkinson's disease, and synucleinopathies, polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, are characterized by the existence of a protein or peptide prone to aggregation specific to the disease: amyloid-$\beta$, tau protein, $\alpha$-synuclein, atrophin 1, androgen receptor, prion protein, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, $\alpha$ 1A subunit of CaV2.1, TATA-box binding protein, huntingtin, and ataxins 1, 2, 3, and 7. Beside this common molecular feature, we have found three additional main properties related to the disease-connected protein or peptide, which are shared by all those neurological disorders: first, proneness to aggregation, which, in many cases, seems to be bound to the lack of a clearly defined secondary structure; second, reported presence of the disease-related protein inside the nucleus; and finally, an apparently unspecific interaction with DNA. These findings, together with the lack of clear details to explain the molecular origin of these neurodegenerative diseases, invite a hypothesis that, together with other plausible molecular explanations, may contribute to find the molecular basis of these diseases: I propose here the hypothesis that many neurological disorders may be the consequence, at least in part, of an aberrant interaction of the disease-related protein with nucleic acids, therefore affecting the normal DNA expression and giving place to a genetic stress which, in turn, alters the expression of proteins needed for the normal cellular function and regulation.},

abstract = {Complex biological systems are organized across various spatiotemporal scales with particular scientific disciplines dedicated to the study of each scale (e.g. genetics, molecular biology and cognitive neuroscience). When considering disease pathophysiology, one must contemplate the scale at which the disease process is being observed and how these processes impact other levels of organization. Historically Alzheimer's disease has been viewed as a disease of abnormally aggregated proteins by pathologists and molecular biologists and a disease of clinical symptoms by neurologists and psychologists. Bridging the divide between these scales has been elusive, but the study of brain networks appears to be a pivotal inroad to accomplish this task. In this study, we were guided by an emerging systems-based conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease and investigated changes in brain networks across the disease spectrum. The default mode network has distinct subsystems with unique functional-anatomic connectivity, cognitive associations, and responses to Alzheimer's pathophysiology. These distinctions provide a window into the systems-level pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Using clinical phenotyping, metadata, and multimodal neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we characterized the pattern of default mode network subsystem connectivity changes across the entire disease spectrum (n = 128). The two main findings of this paper are (i) the posterior default mode network fails before measurable amyloid plaques and appears to initiate a connectivity cascade that continues throughout the disease spectrum; and (ii) high connectivity between the posterior default mode network and hubs of high connectivity (many located in the frontal lobe) is associated with amyloid accumulation. These findings support a system model best characterized by a cascading network failure - analogous to cascading failures seen in power grids triggered by local overloads proliferating to downstream nodes eventually leading to widespread power outages, or systems failures. The failure begins in the posterior default mode network, which then shifts processing burden to other systems containing prominent connectivity hubs. This model predicts a connectivity 'overload' that precedes structural and functional declines and recasts the interpretation of high connectivity from that of a positive compensatory phenomenon to that of a load-shifting process transiently serving a compensatory role. It is unknown whether this systems-level pathophysiology is the inciting event driving downstream molecular events related to synaptic activity embedded in these systems. Possible interpretations include that the molecular-level events drive the network failure, a pathological interaction between the network-level and the molecular-level, or other upstream factors are driving both.},

While this technique is widely used to visualize white matter pathways, the associated uncertainty in fiber orientation and artifacts have, to date, not been visualized in conjunction with the trajectory data. In this work, the bootstrap method was used to determine the distributions of diffusion indices such as trace and anisotropy, together with the uncertainty in fiber orientation. A novel visualization scheme was developed to encode this information at each point along reconstructed trajectories. By integrating these schemes into a graphical user interface, a new tool which we call PASTA (Pointwise Assessment of Streamline Tractography Attributes) was created to facilitate identification of artifacts in tractography that would otherwise go undetected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the leading cause of dementia. Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the first strongly supported LOAD susceptibility genes since the discovery of the involvement of APOE in the early 1990s. We have now exploited these GWAS datasets to uncover key LOAD pathophysiological processes. METHODOLOGY: We applied a recently developed tool for mining GWAS data for biologically meaningful information to a LOAD GWAS dataset. The principal findings were then tested in an independent GWAS dataset. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a significant overrepresentation of association signals in pathways related to cholesterol metabolism and the immune response in both of the two largest genome-wide association studies for LOAD. SIGNIFICANCE: Processes related to cholesterol metabolism and the innate immune response have previously been implicated by pathological and epidemiological studies of Alzheimer's disease, but it has been unclear whether those findings reflected primary aetiological events or consequences of the disease process. Our independent evidence from two large studies now demonstrates that these processes are aetiologically relevant, and suggests that they may be suitable targets for novel and existing therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {The misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins is a seminal occurrence in a remarkable variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer disease (the most prevalent cerebral proteopathy), the two principal aggregating proteins are $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) and tau. The abnormal assemblies formed by conformational variants of these proteins range in size from small oligomers to the characteristic lesions that are visible by optical microscopy, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Pathologic similarities with prion disease suggest that the formation and spread of these proteinaceous lesions might involve a common molecular mechanism-corruptive protein templating. Experimentally, cerebral $\beta$-amyloidosis can be exogenously induced by exposure to dilute brain extracts containing aggregated A$\beta$ seeds. The amyloid-inducing agent probably is A$\beta$ itself, in a conformation generated most effectively in the living brain. Once initiated, A$\beta$ lesions proliferate within and among brain regions. The induction process is governed by the structural and biochemical nature of the A$\beta$ seed, as well as the attributes of the host, reminiscent of pathogenically variant prion strains. The concept of prionlike induction and spreading of pathogenic proteins recently has been expanded to include aggregates of tau, $\alpha$-synuclein, huntingtin, superoxide dismutase-1, and TDP-43, which characterize such human neurodegenerative disorders as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson/Lewy body disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our recent finding that the most effective A$\beta$ seeds are small and soluble intensifies the search in bodily fluids for misfolded protein seeds that are upstream in the proteopathic cascade, and thus could serve as predictive diagnostics and the targets of early, mechanism-based interventions. Establishing the clinical implications of corruptive protein templating will require further mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations. However, the theory that many chronic neurodegenerative diseases can originate and progress via the seeded corruption of misfolded proteins has the potential to unify experimental and translational approaches to these increasingly prevalent disorders.},

abstract = {For several decades scientists have speculated that the key to understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders may be found in the unusual biology of the prion diseases. Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid. Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently intractable diseases.},

However, the functional relationship of APP and its proteolytic derivatives to neuronal electrophysiology is not known. Here, we show that neuronal activity modulates the formation and secretion of Abeta peptides in hippocampal slice neurons that overexpress APP. In turn, Abeta selectively depresses excitatory synaptic transmission onto neurons that overexpress APP, as well as nearby neurons that do not. This depression depends on NMDA-R activity and can be reversed by blockade of neuronal activity. Synaptic depression from excessive Abeta could contribute to cognitive decline during early AD. In addition, we propose that activity-dependent modulation of endogenous Abeta production may normally participate in a negative feedback that could keep neuronal hyperactivity in check. Disruption of this feedback system could contribute to disease progression in AD.},

abstract = {152 ObjectivesTracer Kinetic modeling can add value to clinical studies, but these models often require blood sampling, which has some technical and humanistic limitations, particularly in longitudinal studies within subjects. The image-derived input function (IDIF) has been developed as an alternative. This study compares the reproducibility of the kinetic modeling for a PET brain study using IDIF and AIF for [11C]-PK11195, a marker of microglial activation. MethodsA test-retest protocol was executed in 7 control subjects using [11C]-PK11195. The subjects were given two injections of the tracer on the same day with a two hour interval with no pharmacological intervention. The carotid artery region was used as ROI for the IDIF. Recovery factors and spill-in factors were determined using a static phantom system. These correction factors were applied to the IDIF data to compensate for recovery and spill-in effects. Regions of interest (ROI) were placed with Free Surfer on contemporaneously acquired MRI scans. To compare test-retest reproducibility, Logan-distribution volume (VT) values were calculated three different ways: a partial volume corrected IDIF, an uncorrected IDIF, and the AIF in 22 different regions in the brain. ResultsThe static phantom gave results that were entirely consistent with the known resolution of the scanner and the sizes of the syringes used. The uncorrected and corrected IDIFs were directly compared to the AIFs. The reproducibility was excellent in all regions. The average difference between test and retest with the uncorrected IDIF was 11.1\{+/-\}5%, with the corrected IDIF, this was reduced to 7.5\{+/-\}4.6%, while for AIF the average was 5.5\{+/-\}3.6%. ConclusionsCorrected IDIF can be used as an alternative for AIFs to perform [11C]-PK11195 kinetic modeling in brain analyses. Test-retest reproducibility using the corrected IDIF is similar to the AIF. These conclusions support the feasibility of using a corrected IDIF in longitudinal studies that require multiple measurements within subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), which might be influenced by successful neuroprotective drugs. The uptake of [11 C](R)-PK11195 (PK) is often considered to be a proxy for neuroinflammation, and can be quantified using the Logan graphical method with an image-derived blood input function, or the Logan reference tissue model using automated reference region extraction. The purposes of this study were (1) to assess whether these noninvasive image analysis methods can discriminate between patients with PD and healthy volunteers (HVs), and (2) to establish the effect size that would be required to distinguish true drug-induced changes from system variance in longitudinal trials. METHODS The sample consisted of 20 participants with PD and 19 HVs. Two independent teams analyzed the data to compare the volume of distribution calculated using image-derived input functions (IDIFs), and binding potentials calculated using the Logan reference region model. RESULTS With all methods, the higher signal-to-background in patients resulted in lower variability and better repeatability than in controls. We were able to use noninvasive techniques showing significantly increased uptake of PK in multiple brain regions of participants with PD compared to HVs. CONCLUSION Although not necessarily reflecting absolute values, these noninvasive image analysis methods can discriminate between PD patients and HVs. We see a difference of 24% in the substantia nigra between PD and HV with a repeatability coefficient of 13%, showing that it will be possible to estimate responses in longitudinal, within subject trials of novel neuroprotective drugs.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the importance of the propagation of amyloidogenic proteins such as $\alpha$-synuclein and tau in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been supported by numerous neuropathological and experimental studies. While these proteins behave similarly to prions, recent evidence suggests the existence of fundamental differences, as they can propagate in the absence of endogenous template, they do not exhibit a strict 'strain' behavior, and they may not be transmissible between individuals. We therefore propose to name these proteins ‘prionoids'. In this review we critically assess the extent of the overlap between these two entities and evaluate how the propagation of prionoids can fit into the wider system dysfunction seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.},

Here we identify a developmental transition point of structural and functional rearrangements onto these interneurons around the start of active sensation at P14. Using in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging, we find that before P14, both interneuron types respond stronger to a multi-whisker stimulus, whereas after P14 their responses diverge, with VIP + cells losing their multi-whisker preference and SST + neurons enhancing theirs. Additionally, we find that Ca 2+ signaling dynamics increase in precision as the cells and network mature. Rabies virus tracings followed by tissue clearing, as well as photostimulation-coupled electrophysiology reveal that SST + cells receive higher cross-barrel inputs compared to VIP + neurons at both time points. In addition, whereas prior to P14 both cell types receive direct input from the sensory thalamus, after P14 VIP + cells show reduced inputs and SST + cells largely shift to motor-related thalamic nuclei.},

Here, we have developed a cellular model that allows the study of human AD-derived Tau propagation from neuron to neuron using microfluidic devices. We show by using high-content imaging techniques and an in-house developed interactive computer program that human AD-derived Tau seeds rodent Tau that propagates trans-neuronally in a quantifiable manner in a microfluidic culture model. Moreover, we were able to convert this model to a medium-throughput format allowing the user to handle 16 two-chamber devices simultaneously in the footprint of a standard 96-well plate. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule inhibitor of aggregation can block the trans-neuronal transfer of Tau aggregates, suggesting that the system can be used to evaluate mechanisms of Tau transfer and find therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) feature progressive intraneuronal deposition of aggregated tau protein. The cause is unknown, but in experimental systems trans-cellular propagation of tau pathology resembles prion pathogenesis. Tau aggregate inoculation into mice produces transmissible pathology, and tau forms distinct strains, i.e. conformers that faithfully replicate and create predictable patterns of pathology in vivo. The prion model predicts that tau seed formation will anticipate neurofibrillary tau pathology. To test this idea requires simultaneous assessment of seed titer and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of brain tissue, but it is unknown whether tau seed titer can be determined in formaldehyde-fixed tissue. We have previously created a cellular biosensor system that uses flow cytometry to quantify induced tau aggregation and thus determine seed titer. In unfixed tissue from PS19 tauopathy mice that express 1 N,4R tau (P301S), we have measured tau seeding activity that precedes the first observable histopathology by many months. Additionally, in fresh frozen tissue from human AD subjects at early to mid-neurofibrillary tangle stages (NFT I-IV), we have observed tau seeding activity in cortical regions predicted to lack neurofibrillary pathology. However, we could not directly compare the same regions by IHC and seeding activity in either case. We now describe a protocol to extract and measure tau seeding activity from small volumes (.04 mm3) of formaldehyde-fixed tissue immediately adjacent to that used for IHC. We validated this method with the PS19 transgenic mouse model, and easily observed seeding well before the development of phospho-tau pathology. We also accurately isolated two tau strains, DS9 and DS10, from fixed brain tissues in mice. Finally, we have observed robust seeding activity in fixed AD brain, but not controls. The successful coupling of classical IHC with seeding and strain detection should enable detailed study of banked brain tissue in AD and other tauopathies.},

TDP-43 pathology occurs in distinct brain regions, involves disparate brain networks, and features accumulation of misfolded proteins in various cell types and in different neuroanatomical regions. The clinical phenotypes of ALS and FTLD-TDP (FTLD with abnormal intracellular accumulations of TDP-43) correlate with characteristic distribution patterns of the underlying pathology across specific brain regions with disease progression. Recent studies support the idea that pathological protein spreads from neuron to neuron via axonal transport in a hierarchical manner. However, little is known to date about the basis of the selective cellular and regional vulnerability, although the information would have important implications for the development of targeted and personalized therapies. Here, we aim to summarize recent advances in the neuropathology, genetics and animal models of TDP-43 proteinopathy, and their relationship to clinical phenotypes for the underlying selective neuronal and regional susceptibilities. Finally, we attempt to integrate these findings into the emerging picture of TDP-43 proteinopathy, and to highlight key issues for future therapy and research.},

The raised frequency of the epsilon 4 allele in the patients with late onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease was of a lower magnitude than that in United States and Canadian studies.

Although we have recently shown that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutation manifest myelination defects and ASD-like behaviors, the detailed mechanisms underlying ASD pathogenesis have remained unclear. Here we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in oligodendrocyte lineage-specific Chd8 heterozygous mutant mice. DTI revealed that ablation of Chd8 specifically in oligodendrocytes of mice was associated with microstructural changes of specific brain regions including the cortex and striatum. The extent of these changes in white matter including the corpus callosum and fornix was correlated with total contact time in the reciprocal social interaction test. Analysis with rsfMRI revealed changes in functional brain connectivity in the mutant mice, and the extent of such changes in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was also correlated with the change in social interaction. Our results thus suggest that changes in brain microstructure and functional connectivity induced by oligodendrocyte dysfunction might underlie altered social interaction in mice with oligodendrocyte-specific CHD8 haploinsufficiency.},

abstract = {Understanding the function and connectivity of thalamic nuclei is critical for understanding normal and pathological brain function. The medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) has been studied mostly in the context of auditory processing and its connection to the auditory cortex. However, there is a growing body of evidence that the MGN and surrounding associated areas ('MGN/S') have a diversity of projections including those to the globus pallidus, caudate/putamen, amygdala, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Concomitantly, pathways projecting to the medial geniculate include not only the inferior colliculus but also the auditory cortex, insula, cerebellum, and globus pallidus. Here we expand our understanding of the connectivity of the MGN/S by using comparative diffusion weighted imaging with probabilistic tractography in both human and mouse brains (most previous work was in rats). In doing so, we provide the first report that attempts to match probabilistic tractography results between human and mice. Additionally, we provide anterograde tracing results for the mouse brain, which corroborate the probabilistic tractography findings. Overall, the study provides evidence for the homology of MGN/S patterns of connectivity across species for understanding translational approaches to thalamic connectivity and function. Further, it points to the utility of DTI in both human studies and small animal modeling, and it suggests potential roles of these connections in human cognition, behavior, and disease.},

By analyzing transcriptional covariation in 7,221 intact CNS samples from 840 neurotypical individuals, representing billions of cells, we reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans. By modeling intact CNS transcriptomes as a function of variation in cellular composition, we identify cell-class-specific transcriptional differences in Alzheimer's disease, among brain regions, and between species. Among these, we show that PMP2 is expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes and significantly increases mouse astrocyte size upon ectopic expression in vivo, causing them to more closely resemble their human counterparts. Our work is available as an online resource ( http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/ ) and provides a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems.},

abstract = {Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) erodes complex social-emotional functions as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and frontoinsula (FI) degenerate, but the early vulnerable neuron within these regions has remained uncertain. Previously, we demonstrated selective loss of ACC von Economo neurons (VENs) in bvFTD. Unlike ACC, FI contains a second conspicuous layer 5 neuronal morphotype, the fork cell, which has not been previously examined. Here, we investigated the selectivity, disease-specificity, laterality, timing, and symptom relevance of frontoinsular VEN and fork cell loss in bvFTD. Blinded, unbiased, systematic sampling was used to quantify bilateral FI VENs, fork cells, and neighboring neurons in 7 neurologically unaffected controls (NC), 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 9 patients with bvFTD, including 3 who died of comorbid motor neuron disease during very mild bvFTD. bvFTD showed selective FI VEN and fork cell loss compared with NC and AD, whereas in AD no significant VEN or fork cell loss was detected. Although VEN and fork cell losses in bvFTD were often asymmetric, no group-level hemispheric laterality effects were identified. Right-sided VEN and fork cell losses, however, correlated with each other and with anatomical, functional, and behavioral severity. This work identifies region-specific neuronal targets in early bvFTD.},

abstract = {Although Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease primarily involving basal ganglia and midbrain, the deficit of white matter is also involved during the disease progression. As the diffusion tensor imaging method is sensitive to the microstructural changes, we investigated the microstructural alterations in white matter and deep gray matter in patients with Parkinson's disease. Brain images of 64 patients and sex- and age-matched 64 healthy controls were obtained from a 3T MRI scanner. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare the mean diffusivity of the white matter tract between the groups. Voxel-based analysis was used to compare the mean diffusivity of the subcortical gray matter between the groups. There were white matter deficits in the corticofugal tract, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, crus of fornix or stria terminalis, corpus callosum, external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation including optic radiation, and the tracts adjacent to the precuneus and supramarginal gyrus, as indicated by higher mean diffusivity in Parkinson's disease patients than in controls. There were also deficits in the left putamen, pallidum, thalamus, and caudate as indicated by higher mean diffusivity in Parkinson's disease patients than in controls. Using diffusion tensor imaging and multi-methods of image analysis, we successfully characterized and visualized brain white matter and deep gray matter areas with microstructural deficits in Parkinson's disease patients.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is expressed in the brain and has been detected in macrophages, microglia, and neurons. ABCA7 promotes efflux of lipids from cells to apolipoproteins and can also regulate phagocytosis and modulate processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide. Genome-wide association studies have indicated that ABCA7 single nucleotide polymorphisms confer increased risk for late-onset AD; however, the role that ABCA7 plays in the brain in the AD context is unknown. In the present study, we crossed ABCA7-deficient (A7(-/-)) mice with J20 amyloidogenic mice to address this issue. We show that ABCA7 loss doubled insoluble A$\beta$ levels and thioflavine-S-positive plaques in the brain. This was not related to changes in APP processing (assessed by analysis of full-length APP and the APP $\beta$ C-terminal fragment). Apolipoprotein E regulates cerebral A$\beta$ homeostasis and plaque load; however, the apolipoprotein E concentration was not altered by ABCA7 loss. Spatial reference memory was significantly impaired in both J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice; however, there were no cognitive differences between J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice. There were also no major differences detected in hippocampal or plaque-associated microglial/macrophage markers between J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice, whereas the capacity for bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from A7(-/-) mice to take up oligomeric A$\beta$ was reduced by 51% compared with wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ABCA7 plays a role in the regulation of A$\beta$ homeostasis in the brain and that this may be related to altered phagocyte function.},

abstract = {Astrocytes outnumber neurons in the human brain, and they play a key role in numerous functions within the central nervous system (CNS), including glutamate, ion (i.e., Ca2+, K+) and water homeostasis, defense against oxidative/nitrosative stress, energy storage, mitochondria biogenesis, scar formation, tissue repair via angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and synapse modulation. After CNS injury, astrocytes communicate with surrounding neuronal and vascular systems, leading to the clearance of disease-specific protein aggregates, such as $\beta$-amyloid, and $\alpha$-synuclein. The astrocytic big conductance K+ (BK) channel plays a role in these processes. Recently, potential therapeutic agents that target astrocytes have been tested for their potential to repair the brain. In this review, we discuss the role of the BK channel and antioxidant agents such as heme oxygenase metabolites following CNS injury. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of astrocytes' functions in the healthy and diseased brains will greatly contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches following CNS injury, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke.},

abstract = {The stereotyped features of neuronal circuits are those most likely to explain the remarkable capacity of the brain to process information and govern behaviors, yet it has not been possible to comprehensively quantify neuronal distributions across animals or genders due to the size and complexity of the mammalian brain. Here we apply our quantitative brain-wide (qBrain) mapping platform to document the stereotyped distributions of mainly inhibitory cell types. We discover an unexpected cortical organizing principle: sensory-motor areas are dominated by output-modulating parvalbumin-positive interneurons, whereas association, including frontal, areas are dominated by input-modulating somatostatin-positive interneurons. Furthermore, we identify local cell type distributions with more cells in the female brain in 10 out of 11 sexually dimorphic subcortical areas, in contrast to the overall larger brains in males. The qBrain resource can be further mined to link stereotyped aspects of neuronal distributions to known and unknown functions of diverse brain regions. A quantitative cell-type-based whole-brain anatomical resource reveals new principles of structural organization of the brain},

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is defined histopathologically by extracellular $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) fibrils plus intraneuronal tau filaments. Studies of transgenic mice and cultured cells indicate that AD is caused by a pathological cascade in which A$\beta$ lies upstream of tau, but the steps that connect A$\beta$ to tau have remained undefined. We demonstrate that tau confers acute hypersensitivity of microtubules to prefibrillar, extracellular A$\beta$ in nonneuronal cells that express transfected tau and in cultured neurons that express endogenous tau. Prefibrillar A$\beta$42 was active at submicromolar concentrations, several-fold below those required for equivalent effects of prefibrillar A$\beta$40, and microtubules were insensitive to fibrillar A$\beta$. The active region of tau was localized to an N-terminal domain that does not bind microtubules and is not part of the region of tau that assembles into filaments. These results suggest that a seminal cell biological event in AD pathogenesis is acute, tau-dependent loss of microtubule integrity caused by exposure of neurons to readily diffusible A$\beta$.},

We analyze the accuracy of gray and white matter volume measurements and their robustness against changes of image quality using the BrainWeb MRI database. These images are based on "gold-standard" reference brain templates. This allows us to assess between- (same data set, different method) and also within-segmenter (same method, variation of image quality) comparability, for both of which we find pronounced variations in segmentation results for gray and white matter volumes. The calculated volumes deviate up to >10% from the reference values for gray and white matter depending on method and image quality. Sensitivity is best for SPM5, volumetric accuracy for gray and white matter was similar in SPM5 and FSL and better than in FreeSurfer. FSL showed the highest stability for white (<5%), FreeSurfer (6.2%) for gray matter for constant image quality BrainWeb data. Between-segmenter comparisons show discrepancies of up to >20% for the simulated data and 24% on average for the real data sets, whereas within-method performance analysis uncovered volume differences of up to >15%. Since the discrepancies between results reach the same order of magnitude as volume changes observed in disease, these effects limit the usability of the segmentation methods for following volume changes in individual patients over time and should be taken into account during the planning and analysis of brain volume studies.},

abstract = {Background: Cognitive and motor task performance in premanifest Huntington's disease (HD) gene-carriers is often within normal ranges prior to clinical diagnosis, despite loss of brain volume in regions involved in these tasks. This indicates ongoing compensation, with the brain maintaining function in the presence of neuronal loss. However, thus far, compensatory processes in HD have not been modeled explicitly. Using a new model, which incorporates individual variability related to structural change and behavior, we sought to identify functional correlates of compensation in premanifest-HD gene-carriers. Methods: We investigated the modulatory effects of regional brain atrophy, indexed by structural measures of disease load, on the relationship between performance and brain activity (or connectivity) using task-based and resting-state functional MRI. Findings: Consistent with compensation, as atrophy increased performance-related activity increased in the right parietal cortex during a working memory task. Similarly, increased functional coupling between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a left hemisphere network in the resting-state predicted better cognitive performance as atrophy increased. Such patterns were not detectable for the left hemisphere or for motor tasks. Interpretation: Our findings provide evidence for active compensatory processes in premanifest-HD for cognitive demands and suggest a higher vulnerability of the left hemisphere to the effects of regional atrophy.},

Damages to memory-related brain structures are the likely pathological correlate, and in both illnesses deposition of amyloidogenic proteins are present mainly within these limbic structures. Amyloid-beta-positive plaques and phospho-tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles are the main feature of AD and alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are found in DLB. Interestingly the associated proteins also interfere with synaptic function and synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose that the same neuronal circuits are disturbed within the hippocampal formation in AD and DLB and that in both diseases the associated proteins might lead to changes in synaptic plasticity and function. Thus both classic neuropathological changes and cellular dysfunctions might contribute to the cognitive impairments in AD and DLB.},

abstract = {This report describes the first human study of a novel amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, termed Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), in 16 patients with diagnosed mild AD and 9 controls. Compared with controls, AD patients typically showed marked retention of PIB in areas of association cortex known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, PIB retention was increased most prominently in frontal cortex (1.94-fold, p = 0.0001). Large increases also were observed in parietal (1.71-fold, p = 0.0002), temporal (1.52-fold, p = 0.002), and occipital (1.54-fold, p = 0.002) cortex and the striatum (1.76-fold, p = 0.0001). PIB retention was equivalent in AD patients and controls in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Studies in three young (21 years) and six older healthy controls (69.5 +/- 11 years) showed low PIB retention in cortical areas and no significant group differences between young and older controls. In cortical areas, PIB retention correlated inversely with cerebral glucose metabolism determined with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. This relationship was most robust in the parietal cortex (r = -0.72; p = 0.0001). The results suggest that PET imaging with the novel tracer, PIB, can provide quantitative information on amyloid deposits in living subjects.},

abstract = {To characterize gene expression patterns in the regional subdivisions of the mammalian brain, we integrated spatial gene expression patterns from the Allen Brain Atlas for the adult mouse with panels of cell type-specific genes for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from previously published transcriptome profiling experiments. We found that the combined spatial expression patterns of 170 neuron-specific transcripts revealed strikingly clear and symmetrical signatures for most of the brain's major subdivisions. Moreover, the brain expression spatial signatures correspond to anatomical structures and may even reflect developmental ontogeny. Spatial expression profiles of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes also revealed regional differences; these defined fewer regions and were less distinct but still symmetrical in the coronal plane. Follow-up analysis suggested that region-based clustering of neuron-specific genes was related to (i) a combination of individual genes with restricted expression patterns, (ii) region-specific differences in the relative expression of functional groups of genes, and (iii) regional differences in neuronal density. Products from some of these neuron-specific genes are present in peripheral blood, raising the possibility that they could reflect the activities of disease- or injury-perturbed networks and collectively function as biomarkers for clinical disease diagnostics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To elucidate the characteristics of oldest-old patients with dementia in a Japanese memory clinic. METHODS We evaluated 365 consecutive patients with dementia who were referred to the Memory Clinic of Niigata Rehabilitation Hospital, Niigata, Japan over 4-year period. More than 85% of the patients lived in the communities within 15 km from the hospital. The mean (+/- SD) age at examination was 79.3 +/- 6.9 years, and according to this criterion the patients were classified into 4 groups: young (age less than 65 years), younger-old (65-74 years), older-old (75-84 years), oldest-old (85 years or more). In each patient group, we evaluated the rates of the major dementias and compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS The rates of major dementias in all the patients was as follows: AD, 74.5%; dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 13.7%; frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 3.0%; vascular dementia (VD), 5.5%, and other dementias, 3.3%. The number of patients included in the young group was 9; in the younger-old group, 75; in the older-old group, 203; and in the oldest-old group, 78. The rates of major dementias in each old group was as follows: in the younger-old group, 74.7% for AD, 9.3% for DLB, 6.7% for FTLD, 5.3% for VD and 4.0% for other dementias; in the older-old group, 73.4% for AD, 15.8% for DLB, 1.5% for FTLD, 5.9% for VD, and 3.5% for other dementias; and in the oldest-old group, 78.2% for AD, 14.1% for DLB, 2.6% for FTLD, 3.9% for VD and 1.3% for other dementia. The AD patients in the oldest-old group showed a significantly higher rate of female (younger-old, 64.3%; older-old, 79.2%; and oldest-old, 85.3%; chi2 = 7.9, p < .05), a poorest mean of the score on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (younger-old, 18.5 +/- 10.4; older-old, 19.2 +/- 9.3; and oldest-old, 22.8 +/- 7.6; F = 3.5, p < .05), and a poorest distribution on the Clinical Dementia Rating (chi2 = 13.9, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS The rates of the major dementias were similar in the younger-, older-, and oldest-old groups except for the higher rate of FTLD and the lower rate of DLB, respectively, in the younger-old patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several progressive neurologic disorders begin with cognitive decline or parkinsonism, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We used positron emission tomography (PET) in attempts to differentiate these disorders. METHODS: We performed PET with (+)-[11C]dihydrotetrabenazine ([11C]DTBZ) to examine blood-to-brain ligand transport (K(1)) and striatal monoaminergic presynaptic binding (distribution volume [DV]) in 25 DLB, 30 PD, and 25 AD patients and 57 elderly controls (NC). RESULTS: [11C]DTBZ DV was decreased significantly in caudate nucleus, anterior putamen, and posterior putamen in DLB and PD compared with AD and NC. DLB and PD groups showed an anterior-to-posterior gradient of binding loss relative to NC, least in caudate nucleus and largest in posterior putamen. The gradient was significantly steeper in PD than DLB. Both PD and DLB showed significantly greater interhemispheric striatal binding asymmetry than NC, and PD had greater asymmetry than DLB. Cerebral cortical [11C]DTBZ K(1) was decreased diffusely by 4% to 8% in PD. Larger K(1) deficits occurred in AD and DLB temporoparietal and prefrontal association cortices and posterior cingulate cortex. Greater reduction of K(1) occurred in occipital cortex in DLB than AD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses distinguished DLB from AD more effectively on the basis of striatal DV than occipital K(1) and distinguished DLB from PD more effectively on the basis of cerebral cortical K(1) than striatal DV patterns. Overall, 90% of cases were properly classified by combining these measures. CONCLUSIONS: PET with [11C]DTBZ can differentiate DLB from both PD and AD in a single neuroimaging study.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. In connection with the global trend of prolonging human life and the increasing number of elderly in the population, the AD becomes one of the most serious health and socioeconomic problems of the present. Tau protein promotes assembly and stabilizes microtubules, which contributes to the proper function of neuron. Alterations in the amount or the structure of tau protein can affect its role as a stabilizer of microtubules as well as some of the processes in which it is implicated. The molecular mechanisms governing tau aggregation are mainly represented by several posttranslational modifications that alter its structure and conformational state. Hence, abnormal phosphorylation and truncation of tau protein have gained attention as key mechanisms that become tau protein in a pathological entity. Evidences about the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated and truncated tau have been documented during the progression of AD as well as their capacity to exert cytotoxicity when expressed in cell and animal models. This paper describes the normal structure and function of tau protein and its major alterations during its pathological aggregation in AD.},

abstract = {Long-haul transport along microtubules is crucial for neuronal polarity, and transport defects cause neurodegeneration. Tau protein stabilizes microtubule tracks, but in Alzheimer's disease it aggregates and becomes missorted into the somatodendritic compartment. Tau can inhibit axonal transport by obstructing motors on microtubules, yet tau itself can still move into axons. We therefore investigated tau movement by live-cell fluorescence microscopy, FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), and FSM (fluorescence speckle microscopy). Tau is highly dynamic, with diffusion coefficients of ∼3 $\mu$m2/s and microtubule dwell times of ∼4 s. This facilitates the entry of tau into axons over distances of millimeters and periods of days. For longer distances and times, two mechanisms of tau transport are observed. At low near-physiological levels, tau is cotransported with microtubule fragments from cell bodies into axons, moving at instantaneous velocities ∼1 $\mu$m/s. At high concentrations, tau forms local accumulations moving bidirectionally at ∼0.3 $\mu$m/s. These clusters first appear at distal endings of axons and may indicate an early stage of neurite degeneration. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Neuroscience.},

abstract = {Multiple laboratories have recently demonstrated that long-term dopaminergic transplants form Lewy bodies in patients with Parkinson's disease. Debate has arisen as to whether these Lewy bodies form from the transfer of $\alpha$ synuclein from the host to the graft or whether they form from intrinsic responses of the graft from being placed into what was, or became, an inflammatory focus. To test whether the former hypothesis was possible, we grafted fetal rat ventral mesencephalon into the dopamine depleted striatum of rats that had previously received 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. One month after the transplant, rats received viral over expression of human $\alpha$ synuclein (AAV2/6-$\alpha$ synuclein) or green fluorescent protein (AAV2/6-GFP) into the striatum rostral to the grafts. Care was taken to make sure that the AAV injections were sufficiently distal to the graft so no cells would be directly transfected. All rats were sacrificed five weeks after the virus injections. Double label immunohistochemistry combined with confocal microscopy revealed that a small number of grafted tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons (5.7% ± 1.5% (mean ± SEM) of grafted dopamine cells) expressed host derived $\alpha$ synuclein but none of the grafted cells expressed host-derived GFP. The $\alpha$ synuclein in a few of these cells was misfolded and failed to be digested with proteinase K. These data indicate that it is possible for host derived $\alpha$ synuclein to transfer to grafted neurons supporting the concept that this is one possible mechanism by which grafted dopamine neurons form Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease patients.},

PV immunoreactive (PV-I) perikarya were concentrated in the granule cell layer and hilus in the dentate gyrus and in the stratum pyramidale and stratum oriens in the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. They were rare in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in the stratum radiatum and in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus. PV-I axon terminals were restricted to the granule cell layer, the stratum pyramidale and the immediately adjoining zones of these layers. Almost all PV-I neurons were also GAD immunoreactive (GAD-I), whereas only about 20% of GAD-I neurons also contained PV. The percentages of GAD-I neurons which were also immunoreactive for PV were dependent on the layer in which they were found; i.e. 40-50% in the stratum pyramidale, 20-30% in the dentate granule cell layer and in the stratum of CA3 and CA1 regions, 15-20% in the hilus and in the stratum lucidum of CA3 region and only 1-4% in the dentate molecular layer in the stratum radiatum and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA3 and CA1 regions. PV-I neurons are a particular subpopulation of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampal formation.

Thus Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment strategies based solely on the amyloid-$\beta$ clearance should be re-examined in light of the vast accumulating evidence that increased oxidative stress in the human brains is the key causative factor for AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that the reduced brain glucose availability and brain hypoxia, due to the relatively lower concentration of ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, may be associated with increased concentration of endogenous ammonia, a potential neurotoxin in the AD brains. In this review, we summarize the progress in this area, and present some of our ongoing research activities with regard to brain amyloid-$\beta$, systemic ammonia, erythrocyte energy metabolism and the role of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in AD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by neuronal loss and cerebral deposition of proteins with altered physicochemical properties. The major proteins are amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$), tau, $\alpha$-synuclein, and TDP-43. Although neuropathological studies on elderly individuals have emphasised the importance of mixed pathologies, there have been few observations on the full spectrum of proteinopathies in the ageing brain. During a community-based study we performed comprehensive mapping of neurodegeneration-related proteins and vascular pathology in the brains of 233 individuals (age at death 77-87; 73 examined clinically in detail). While all brains (from individuals with and without dementia) showed some degree of neurofibrillary degeneration, A$\beta$ deposits were observed only in 160 (68.7 %). Further pathologies included $\alpha$-synucleinopathies (24.9 %), non-Alzheimer tauopathies (23.2 %; including novel forms), TDP-43 proteinopathy (13.3 %), vascular lesions (48.9 %), and others (15.1 %; inflammation, metabolic encephalopathy, and tumours). TDP-43 proteinopathy correlated with hippocampal sclerosis (p < 0.001) and Alzheimer-related pathology (CERAD score and Braak and Braak stages, p = 0.001). The presence of one specific variable (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, A$\beta$ parenchymal deposits, TDP-43 proteinopathy, $\alpha$-synucleinopathy, vascular lesions, non-Alzheimer type tauopathy) did not increase the probability of the co-occurrence of others (p = 0.24). The number of observed pathologies correlated with AD-neuropathologic change (p < 0.0001). In addition to AD-neuropathologic change, tauopathies associated well with dementia, while TDP-43 pathology and $\alpha$-synucleinopathy showed strong effects but lost significance when evaluated together with AD-neuropathologic change. Non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies and their combinations have been underestimated, but are frequent in reality as demonstrated here. This should be considered in diagnostic evaluation of biomarkers, and for better clinical stratification of patients.},

abstract = {Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a 4R-tauopathy predominated by subcortical pathology in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia associated with various clinical phenotypes. In the present international study, we addressed the question of whether or not sequential distribution patterns can be recognized for PSP pathology. We evaluated heat maps and distribution patterns of neuronal, astroglial, and oligodendroglial tau pathologies and their combinations in different clinical subtypes of PSP in postmortem brains. We used conditional probability and logistic regression to model the sequential distribution of tau pathologies across different brain regions. Tau pathology uniformly predominates in the neurons of the pallido-nigro-luysian axis in different clinical subtypes. However, clinical subtypes are distinguished not only by total tau load but rather cell-type (neuronal versus glial) specific vulnerability patterns of brain regions suggesting distinct dynamics or circuit-specific segregation of propagation of tau pathologies. For Richardson syndrome ( n = 81) we recognize six sequential steps of involvement of brain regions by the combination of cellular tau pathologies. This is translated to six stages for the practical neuropathological diagnosis by the evaluation of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, striatum, cerebellum with dentate nucleus, and frontal and occipital cortices. This system can be applied to further clinical subtypes by emphasizing whether they show caudal (cerebellum/dentate nucleus) or rostral (cortical) predominant, or both types of pattern. Defining cell-specific stages of tau pathology helps to identify preclinical or early-stage cases for the better understanding of early pathogenic events, has implications for understanding the clinical subtype-specific dynamics of disease-propagation, and informs tau-neuroimaging on distribution patterns.},

TSPO binding in temporoparietal regions increased from 3.9% to 6.3% per annum in patients, but ranged from -0.5% to 1% per annum in controls. The change in TSPO binding correlated with cognitive worsening on clinical dementia rating scale-sum of boxes and reduced cortical volume. The annual rate of increased TSPO binding in temporoparietal regions was about 5-fold higher in patients with clinical progression (n = 9) compared with those who did not progress (n = 5).

abstract = {This study compared rates of regional atrophy in Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and semantic dementia (SD). Cross-sectional studies have shown that different dementia syndromes are associated with different patterns of regional brain tissue loss. Rates of atrophy over time may be useful for differential diagnosis, and could be used to monitor disease progression, serving as an outcome measure for clinical trials. We studied patients with AD (n=12), FTD (n=13), SD (n=20), and normal controls (n=23) longitudinally with structural magnetic resonance imaging, using BRAINS2 software to measure frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe volumes. In FTD the rate of frontal lobe atrophy over 1 year was greater than in any other group, whereas SD showed the highest rate in the temporal lobes. Atrophy in these regions progressed twice as quickly in FTD and SD compared with AD. Atrophy was not significantly faster for AD in any brain region compared with the other groups. Regional atrophy over time was significantly faster in FTD and SD compared with AD, and the regions of greatest atrophy were specific for each syndrome. Measuring specific regions of cerebral volume changes by serial neuroimaging may serve as a useful biomarker outcome measure for clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Both the size and location of injury in the brain influences the type and severity of cognitive or sensorimotor dysfunction. However, even with advances in MR imaging and analysis, the correspondence between lesion location and clinical deficit remains poorly understood. Here, structural and diffusion images from 14 healthy subjects are used to create spatially unbiased white matter connectivity importance maps that quantify the amount of disruption to the overall brain network that would be incurred if that region were compromised. Some regions in the white matter that were identified as highly important by such maps have been implicated in strategic infarct dementia and linked to various attention tasks in previous studies. Validation of the maps is performed by investigating the correlations of the importance maps' predicted cognitive deficits in a group of 15 traumatic brain injury patients with their cognitive test scores measuring attention and memory. While no correlation was found between amount of white matter injury and cognitive test scores, significant correlations (r>0.68, p<0.006) were found when including location information contained in the importance maps. These tools could be used by physicians to improve surgical planning, diagnosis, and assessment of disease severity in a variety of pathologies like multiple sclerosis, trauma, and stroke.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of brain dysfunction caused by disease or injury requires the quantification of resultant neural connectivity changes compared with the normal state. There are many methods with which to assess anatomical changes in structural or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, but most overlook the topology of white matter (WM) connections that make up the healthy brain network. Here, a new neuroimaging software pipeline called the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool is presented that associates alterations in WM integrity with expected changes in neural connectivity between gray matter regions. The NeMo Tool uses a large reference set of healthy tractograms to assess implied network changes arising from a particular pattern of WM alteration on a region- and network-wise level. In this way, WM integrity changes can be extrapolated to the cortices and deep brain nuclei, enabling assessment of functional and cognitive alterations. Unlike current techniques that assess network dysfunction, the NeMo tool does not require tractography in pathological brains for which the algorithms may be unreliable or diffusion data are unavailable. The versatility of the NeMo Tool is demonstrated by applying it to data from patients with Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and mild traumatic brain injury. This tool fills a gap in the quantitative neuroimaging field by enabling an investigation of morphological and functional implications of changes in structural WM integrity.},

abstract = {It is well known that gray matter changes occur in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), and several studies have investigated their respective patterns of atrophy progression. Recent work, however, has revealed that diffusion MRI that is able to detect white matter integrity changes may be an earlier or more sensitive biomarker in both diseases. However, studies that examine white matter changes only are limited in that they do not provide the functional specificity of GM region-based analysis. In this study, we develop a new metric called the Loss in Connectivity (LoCo) score that gives the amount of structural network disruption incurred by a gray matter region for a particular pattern of white matter integrity loss. Leveraging the relative strengths of WM and GM markers, this metric links areas of WM integrity loss to their connected GM regions as a first step in understanding their functional implications. The LoCo score is calculated for three groups: 18AD, 18 FTD, and 19 age-matched normal controls. We show significant correlations of the LoCo with the respective atrophy patterns in AD (R=0.51, p=2.2 × 10(-9)) and FTD (R=0.49, p=2.5 × 10(-8)) for a standard 116 region gray matter atlas. In addition, we demonstrate that the LoCo outperforms a measure of gray matter atrophy when classifying individuals into AD, FTD, and normal groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies show that white matter hyperintensities, regardless of location, primarily affect frontal lobe metabolism and function. This report investigated how regional white matter integrity (measured as fractional anisotropy [FA]) relates to brain metabolism, to unravel the complex relationship between white matter changes and brain metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between white matter integrity and gray matter metabolism using diffusion tensor imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in a cohort of 16 subjects ranging from normal to demented (age, >55 years). METHODS: Mean FA values from white matter regions underlying the medial prefrontal, inferior-lateral prefrontal, parietal association, and posterior temporal areas and the corpus callosum were regressed with glucose metabolism (by positron emission tomography), using statistical parametric mapping (P < 0.005; voxel cluster, >100). Regional cerebral glucose metabolism was the primary outcome measure. According to our hypothesis, those hypometabolic cortical regions affected by Alzheimer's disease would correlate with a lower FA of associated tracks. RESULTS: Our data show inter-regional positive correlations between FA and gray matter metabolism for the prefrontal cortex, temporal, and parietal regions. Our results suggest that left prefrontal FA is associated with left temporal and parietal metabolism. Further, left posterior temporal FA correlated with left prefrontal metabolism. Finally, bilateral parietal FA correlated with bilateral temporal metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These regions are associated with cognitive processes affected in Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease, suggesting a link with white matter degeneration and gray matter hypometabolism. Therefore, cortical function and white matter degeneration are related in aging and dementia.},

@article{Kuo1996,
abstract = {Ultracentrifugation and graded molecular sieving, as well as a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to isolate and quantitate the amounts of water-soluble oligomers of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides N-40 and N-42 in cerebral cortex of normal and Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. AD brains contained 6-fold more water-soluble Abeta (wsAbeta) than control brains. The majority of water-soluble peptides in most AD cases was A beta N-42, representing 12 times the amount found in control brains. The wsAbeta was present in the form of monomers and oligomers ranging from less than 10 kDa to greater than 100 kDa. The amount of wsAbeta N-42 in AD brains is about 50 times greater than the level of soluble Abeta N-42 found in the CSF of AD patients. This disparity may be due to the rapid association of wsAbeta N-42 into fibrillar deposits and/or to the integrity of the anatomical barriers which separate the two extracellular spaces. In this paper, we consider soluble any form of Abeta which has not yet polymerized into its insoluble, filamentous form. This includes both the newly synthesized forms of Abeta and those peptides which may be loosely attached to insoluble filaments but which can, nevertheless, still be considered soluble. It has been previously shown that, once it has aggregated into its filamentous form, the Abeta peptides are resistant to disaggregation and degradation by a number of denaturing agents and aqueous buffers containing proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, it is likely that the water-soluble Abeta peptides we quantified are precursors to its insoluble, filamentous form. Consequently, reducing the levels of soluble Abeta in AD brains could have profound effects on AD pathophysiology.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that enables the investigation of the production and intracellular transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein in a neuron. We also investigate the aggregation of APP fragments into amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) as well as tau aggregation into tau oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles. Using the developed model, we investigate how A$\beta$ aggregation can influence tau transport and aggregation in both the soma and the axon. We couple the A$\beta$ and tau agglomeration processes by assuming that the value of the kinetic constant that describes the autocatalytic growth (self-replication) reaction step of tau aggregation is proportional to the A$\beta$ concentration. The model predicts that APP and tau are distributed differently in the axon. While APP has a uniform distribution along the axon, tau's concentration first decreases and then increases towards the synapse. A$\beta$ is uniformly produced along the axon while misfolded tau protein is mostly produced in the proximal axon. The number of A$\beta$ and tau polymers originating from the axon is much smaller than the number of A$\beta$ and tau polymers originating from the soma. The rate of production of misfolded tau polymers depends on how strongly their production is facilitated by A$\beta$.},

abstract = {In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to investigate the fate of tau protein in the axon terminal. We developed a comprehensive model of tau transport that accounts for transport of cytosolic tau by diffusion, diffusion transport of microtubule (MT)-bound tau along the MT lattice, active motor-driven transport of MT-bound tau via slow axonal transport mechanism, and degradation of tau in the axon due to tau's finite half-life. We investigated the effect of different assumptions concerning the fate of tau in the terminal on steady-state transport of tau in the axon. In particular, we studied two possible scenarios: (i) tau is destroyed in the terminal and (ii) there is no tau destruction in the terminal, and to avoid tau accumulation we postulated zero flux of tau at the terminal. We found that the tau concentration and percentage of MT-bound tau are not very sensitive to the assumption concerning the fate of tau in the terminal, but the tau's flux and average velocity of tau transport are very sensitive to this assumption. This suggests that measuring the velocity of tau transport and comparing it with the results of mathematical modeling for different assumptions concerning tau's fate in the terminal can provide information concerning what happens to tau in the terminal.},

abstract = {Gray matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism, and $\beta$-amyloid A$\beta$ deposition are well-described hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, but their relationships are poorly understood. The present study aims to compare the local levels of these three alterations in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Structural magnetic resonance imaging, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and (18)F-florbetapir PET data from 34 amyloid-negative healthy controls and 20 demented patients with a high probability of Alzheimer's disease etiology (attested using neuroimaging biomarkers as recently recommended) were analyzed. For each patient and imaging modality, age-adjusted Z-score maps were computed, and direct between-modality voxelwise comparison and correlation analyses were performed. Significant differences in the levels of atrophy, hypometabolism, and A$\beta$ deposition were found in most brain areas, but the hierarchy differed across regions. A cluster analysis revealed distinct subsets of regions: (1) in the hippocampus, atrophy exceeded hypometabolism, whereas A$\beta$ load was minimal; (2) in posterior association areas, A$\beta$ deposition was predominant, together with high hypometabolism and lower but still significant atrophy; and (3) in frontal regions, A$\beta$ deposition was maximal, whereas structural and metabolic alterations were low. Atrophy and hypometabolism significantly correlated in the hippocampus and temporo-parietal cortex, whereas A$\beta$ load was not significantly related to either atrophy or hypometabolism. These findings provide direct evidence for regional variations in the hierarchy and relationships between A$\beta$ load, hypometabolism, and atrophy. Altogether, these variations probably reflect the differential involvement of region-specific pathological or protective mechanisms, such as the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, disconnection, as well as compensation processes.},

abstract = {Deposits of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein are found in numerous neurodegenerative disorders; the 'tauopathies', which include Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases, but tau pathology is also found in the ageing brain. Variation in tau pathology in brain ageing and its relationship to development of tauopathies and cognitive impairment remains unclear. We aimed to determine the extent and pattern of spread of tau pathology in the hippocampus, a susceptible region important in dementia and milder states of memory impairment, using hippocampal samples from the elderly population-based Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study neuropathology cohort. Tau deposition was assessed in hippocampal anatomical sub-regions using the AT8 antibody to phosphorylated tau and isoform-specific antibodies to 3 and 4-repeat tau (RD3 and RD4). Abeta pathology was also assessed. In this population sample, which includes the full ageing spectrum from individuals with no cognitive impairment to those with dementia satisfying clinico-pathology criteria for Alzheimer's disease, we have demonstrated a high prevalence at death of tau pathology. AT8, Abeta, RD3 and RD4 showed similar regional distribution and increased RD3 was noted in late-stage ghost tangles. Abeta was shown to be a poor explanatory variable for tau pathology. Tau deposition progressed in a hierarchical manner. Hippocampal input regions and projection zones (such as lateral entorhinal cortex, CA1/subiculum border and outer molecular layer of dentate) were initially affected, with anterograde progression though the hippocampal circuitry. Six hippocampal tau anatomical stages were defined, each linking projectionally to their adjacent stages, suggesting spread of tau malfunction through neuroanatomical pathways in hippocampal ageing. These stages were significantly associated with dementia, and may provide a clinically useful tool in the clinico-pathological assessment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.},

Recent advances in recapitulating both plaques and tangles in the brains of transgenic mice are leading to novel insights into their role in the degenerative process, including their impact on synaptic activity and plasticity. Transgenic mice that harbor both neuropathological lesions are also facilitating the elucidation of the relationship of these proteinaceous aggregates to one another and providing a crucial in vivo system for developing and evaluating therapies.},

abstract = {The relationships between clinical phenotype, $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) deposition and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are incompletely understood yet have important ramifications for future therapy. The goal of this study was to utilize multimodality positron emission tomography (PET) data from a clinically heterogeneous population of patients with probable AD in order to: (1) identify spatial patterns of A$\beta$ deposition measured by ((11)C)-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET) and glucose metabolism measured by FDG-PET that correlate with specific clinical presentation and (2) explore associations between spatial patterns of A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism across the AD population. We included all patients meeting the criteria for probable AD (NIA-AA) who had undergone MRI, PiB and FDG-PET at our center (N = 46, mean age 63.0 ± 7.7, Mini-Mental State Examination 22.0 ± 4.8). Patients were subclassified based on their cognitive profiles into an amnestic/dysexecutive group (AD-memory; n = 27), a language-predominant group (AD-language; n = 10) and a visuospatial-predominant group (AD-visuospatial; n = 9). All patients were required to have evidence of amyloid deposition on PiB-PET. To capture the spatial distribution of A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism, we employed parallel independent component analysis (pICA), a method that enables joint analyses of multimodal imaging data. The relationships between PET components and clinical group were examined using a Receiver Operator Characteristic approach, including age, gender, education and apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 allele carrier status as covariates. Results of the first set of analyses independently examining the relationship between components from each modality and clinical group showed three significant components for FDG: a left inferior frontal and temporoparietal component associated with AD-language (area under the curve [AUC] 0.82, p = 0.011), and two components associated with AD-visuospatial (bilateral occipito-parieto-temporal [AUC 0.85, p = 0.009] and right posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]/precuneus and right lateral parietal [AUC 0.69, p = 0.045]). The AD-memory associated component included predominantly bilateral inferior frontal, cuneus and inferior temporal, and right inferior parietal hypometabolism but did not reach significance (AUC 0.65, p = 0.062). None of the PiB components correlated with clinical group. Joint analysis of PiB and FDG with pICA revealed a correlated component pair, in which increased frontal and decreased PCC/precuneus PiB correlated with decreased FDG in the frontal, occipital and temporal regions (partial r = 0.75, p < 0.0001). Using multivariate data analysis, this study reinforced the notion that clinical phenotype in AD is tightly linked to patterns of glucose hypometabolism but not amyloid deposition. These findings are strikingly similar to those of univariate paradigms and provide additional support in favor of specific involvement of the language network, higher-order visual network, and default mode network in clinical variants of AD. The inverse relationship between A$\beta$ deposition and glucose metabolism in partially overlapping brain regions suggests that A$\beta$ may exert both local and remote effects on brain metabolism. Applying multivariate approaches such as pICA to multimodal imaging data is a promising approach for unraveling the complex relationships between different elements of AD pathophysiology.},

Animal studies have demonstrated the existence of three functional sub-zones but these have never been shown conclusively in humans. In this work, a data driven method with diffusion weighted imaging demonstrated that three distinct clusters exist within the human STN based on brain connectivity profiles. The STN was successfully sub-parcellated into these regions, demonstrating good correspondence with that described in the animal literature. The local connectivity of each sub-region supported the hypothesis of bilateral limbic, associative and motor regions occupying the anterior, mid and posterior portions of the nucleus respectively. This study is the first to achieve in-vivo, non-invasive anatomical parcellation of the human STN into three anatomical zones within normal diagnostic scan times, which has important future implications for deep brain stimulation surgery.},

However, the drug is complicated by a wide range of adverse effects, most notably motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Long-acting dopamine agonists are associated with a reduced incidence of these complications and modern surgical approaches and pharmacological methods of providing more continuous dopaminergic stimulation have a substantial ameliorative effect on these problems. Despite these advances, disease progression remains unaffected. For this reason there has been much enthusiasm for cellular therapies designed to replace degenerating nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. However, recent fetal transplant trials have failed to show expected benefit and have been complicated by medication dyskinesias". Even if successful, such treatment may be predestined to provide no better outcome than available treatments given current medical and surgical experience that emphasises the increasingly critical role of "non-dopaminergic" symptoms to quality of life in late-stage PD. Knowledge of the widespread, multisystem nature of the neurodegeneration that accounts for these problems suggests that restoration of the nigrostriatal dopamine system should not be the ultimate goal of future research.},

A number of statistical models elucidating the relationship between CAG length and AOO have recently been published. In the present article, we review the published formulae, summarize essential differences in participant sources, statistical methodologies, and predictive results. We argue that unrepresentative sampling and failure to use appropriate survival analysis methodology may have substantially biased much of the literature. We also explain why the survival analysis perspective is necessary if any such model is to undergo prospective validation. We use prospective diagnostic data from the PREDICT-HDlongitudinal study ofCAG-expanded participants to test conditional predictions derived from two survival models of AOO of HD. A prior model of the relationship of CAG and AOO originally published by Langbehn et al. yields reasonably accurate predictions, while a similar model by Gutierrez and MacDonald substantially overestimates diagnosis risk for all but the highest risk participants in this sample. The Langbehn et al. model appears accurate enough to have substantial utility in various research contexts.Wealso emphasize remaining caveats, many of which are relevant for any direct application to genetic counseling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A unique feature of the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB regulates substance influx and efflux to maintain a homeostatic environment for proper brain function. Here, we review the development and cell biology of the BBB, focusing on the cellular and molecular regulation of barrier formation and the maintenance of the BBB through adulthood. We summarize unique features of CNS endothelial cells and highlight recent progress in and general principles of barrier regulation. Finally, we illustrate why a mechanistic understanding of the development and maintenance of the BBB could provide novel therapeutic opportunities for CNS drug delivery.},

abstract = {The tauopathy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is first observed in the brainstem and entorhinal cortex, spreading trans-synaptically along specific pathways to other brain regions with recognizable patterns. Tau propagation occurs retrogradely and anterogradely (trans-synaptically) along a given pathway and through exosomes and microglial cells. Some aspects of in vivo tau spreading have been replicated in transgenic mice models expressing a mutated human MAPT (tau) gene and in wild-type mice. In this study, we aimed to characterize the propagation of different forms of tau species in non-transgenic 3–4 months old wild-type rats after a single unilateral injection of human tau oligomers and tau fibrils into the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). We determined whether different variants of the inoculated human tau protein, tau fibrils, and tau oligomers, would induce similar neurofibrillary changes and propagate in an AD-related pattern, and how tau-related pathological changes would correlate with presumed cognitive impairment. We injected human tau fibrils and tau oligomers stereotaxically into the mEC and examined the distribution of tau-related changes at 3 days and 4, 8, and 11 months post-injection using antibodies AT8 and MC1, which reveal early phosphorylation and aberrant conformation of tau, respectively, HT7, anti-synaptophysin, and the Gallyas silver staining method. Human tau oligomers and tau fibrils exhibited some similarities and some differences in their ability to seed and propagate tau-related changes. Both human tau fibrils and tau oligomers rapidly propagated from the mEC anterogradely into the hippocampus and various parts of the neocortex. However, using a human tau-specific HT7 antibody, 3 days post-injection we found inoculated human tau oligomers in the red nucleus, primary motor, and primary somatosensory cortex, a finding not seen in animals inoculated with human tau fibrils. In animals inoculated with human tau fibrils, 3 days post-injection the HT7 antibody showed fibrils in the pontine reticular nucleus, a finding explained only by uptake of human tau fibrils by incoming presynaptic fibers to the mEC and retrograde transport of inoculated human tau fibrils to the brainstem. Rats inoculated with human tau fibrils showed as early as 4 months after inoculation a spread of phosphorylated tau protein at the AT8 epitopes throughout the brain, dramatically faster propagation of neurofibrillary changes than with human tau oligomers. The overall severity of tau protein changes 4, 8, and 11 months after inoculation of human tau oligomers and tau fibrils correlated well with spatial working memory and cognition impairments, as measured by the T-maze spontaneous alternation, novel object recognition, and object location tests. We concluded that this non-trangenic rat model of tauopathy, especially when using human tau fibrils, demonstrates rapidly developing pathologic alterations in neurons, synapses, and identifiable pathways together with cognitive and behavioral changes, through the anterograde and retrograde spreading of neurofibrillary degeneration. Therefore, it represents a promising model for future experimental studies of primary and secondary tauopathies, especially AD.},

Correlation with histopathology of the corresponding regions revealed typical frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type, with mild frontotemporal degeneration in the outer cortical layers and a moderate frontal white matter gliosis with demyelination.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prominent cause of senile dementia, is clinically characterized by the extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It has been well accepted that AD pathogenesis arises from perturbation in the homeostasis of Abeta in the brain. Abeta is normally produced at high levels in the brain and cleared in an equivalent rate. Thus, even a moderate decrease in the clearance leads to the accumulation of Abeta and subsequent amyloid deposition. Microglia are the tissue macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) and have been shown to play major roles in internalization and degradation of Abeta. Abeta exists in the brain both in soluble and in fibrillar forms. Microglia interact with these two forms of Abeta in different ways. They take up soluble forms of Abeta through macropinocytosis and LDL receptor-related proteins (LRPs) mediated pathway. Fibrillar forms of Abeta interact with the cell surface innate immune receptor complex, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that stimulate phagocytosis. Inflammatory responses influence the activation status of microglia and subsequently regulate their ability to take up and degrade Abeta. ApoE and its receptors have been shown to play critical roles in these processes. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms that microglia utilize to clear Abeta and the effectors that modulate the processes.},

It is critical for timely treatment to detect AD in its earlier stage before clinical manifestation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between cognitively normal older adults and AD. To predict conversion from MCI to probable AD, we applied a deep learning approach, multimodal recurrent neural network. We developed an integrative framework that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The proposed framework integrated longitudinal multi-domain data. Our results showed that 1) our prediction model for MCI conversion to AD yielded up to 75% accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) when using only single modality of data separately; and 2) our prediction model achieved the best performance with 81% accuracy (AUC = 0.86) when incorporating longitudinal multi-domain data. A multi-modal deep learning approach has potential to identify persons at risk of developing AD who might benefit most from a clinical trial or as a stratification approach within clinical trials.},

abstract = {Misfolding and abnormal aggregation of the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related neurological disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. alpha-synuclein is a conventional cytosolic protein and is thought to exert its pathogenic function exclusively in the neuronal cytoplasm in a cell-autonomous manner. However, the current model is being challenged by a series of new observations that demonstrate the presence of alpha-synuclein and its aggregated forms in the extracellular fluid both in vivo and in vitro. Extracellular alpha-synuclein appears to be delivered by unconventional exocytosis of intravesicular alpha-synuclein, although the exact mechanism has not been characterized. Compared to the cytosolic alpha-synuclein, intravesicular alpha-synuclein is prone to aggregation and the potential source of extracellular aggregates. A number of tissue culture studies suggest that exposure to extracellular alpha-synuclein aggregates induces microglial activation, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from astrocytes, and neurotoxicity. Thus, exocytosis of alpha-synuclein may be an important mechanism for amplifying and spreading degenerative changes from a small group of cells to its surrounding tissues, and it potentially provides therapeutic targets for halting the progression of the disease.},

abstract = {ALS is a fatal adult-onset motor neuron disease. Motor neurons in the cortex, brain stem and spinal cord gradually degenerate in ALS patients, and most ALS patients die within 3$\sim$5 years of disease onset due to respiratory failure. The major pathological hallmark of ALS is abnormal accumulation of protein inclusions containing TDP-43, FUS or SOD1 protein. Moreover, the focality of clinical onset and regional spreading of neurodegeneration are typical features of ALS. These clinical data indicate that neurodegeneration in ALS is an orderly propagating process, which seems to share the signature of a seeded self-propagation with pathogenic prion proteins. In vitro and cell line experimental evidence suggests that SOD1, TDP-43 and FUS form insoluble fibrillar aggregates. Notably, these protein fibrillar aggregates can act as seeds to trigger the aggregation of native counterparts. Collectively, a self-propagation mechanism similar to prion replication and spreading may underlie the pathology of ALS. In this review, we will briefly summarize recent evidence to support the prion-like properties of major ALS-associated proteins and discuss the possible therapeutic strategies for ALS based on a prion-like mechanism.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The defining neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease are abundant filamentous tau lesions and deposits of fibrillar amyloid $\beta$ peptides. Prominent filamentous tau inclusions and brain degeneration in the absence of $\beta$-amyloid deposits are also hallmarks of neurodegenerative tauopathies exemplified by sporadic corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Pick's disease, as well as by hereditary frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Because multiple tau gene mutations are pathogenic for FTDP-17 and tau polymorphisms appear to be genetic risk factors for sporadic progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, tau abnormalities are linked directly to the etiology and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Indeed, emerging data support the hypothesis that different tau gene mutations are pathogenic because they impair tau functions, promote tau fibrillization, or perturb tau gene splicing, thereby leading to formation of biochemically and structurally distinct aggregates of tau. Nonetheless, different members of the same kindred often exhibit diverse FTDP-17 syndromes, which suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic factors influence the phenotypic manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Although these and other hypothetical mechanisms of neurodegenerative tauopathies remain to be tested and validated, transgenic models are increasingly available for this purpose, and they will accelerate discovery of more effective therapies for neurodegenerative tauopathies and related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.},

Recent developments in structural MRI, including relaxometry, magnetization transfer, and neuromelanin imaging, have demonstrated improved contrast and enabled more accurate visualization of deep brain nuclei, in particular, the substantia nigra. Meanwhile, diffusion imaging has provided useful biomarkers of substantia nigra degeneration, showing reduced anisotropy and anatomical connectivity with the striatum and thalamus. These advances in structural imaging are complemented by findings of magnetic resonance spectroscopy on brain metabolism and resting-state functional MRI on functional connectivity. This article presents an overview of these new structural, metabolic, and resting-state functional MRI techniques and their implications for Parkinson's disease. The techniques are reviewed in the context of their potential for better understanding the disease in terms of diagnosis and pathophysiology and as biomarkers of its progression.},

abstract = {A significant minority of Alzheimer's disease patients present with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). PCA is characterized by visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits, and relatively preserved memory, whereas patients with typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) mostly present with early episodic memory deficits. We used two unbiased image analysis techniques to assess atrophy patterns in 48 PCA, 30 tAD, and 50 healthy controls. FreeSurfer was used to measure cortical thickness, and volumetric grey matter differences were assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Both PCA and tAD showed widespread reductions compared with controls using both techniques. Direct comparison of PCA and tAD revealed thinner cortex predominantly in the right superior parietal lobe in the PCA group compared with tAD, whereas the tAD group showed thinning in the left entorhinal cortex compared with PCA. Similar results were obtained in the VBM analysis. These distinct patterns of atrophy may have diagnostic utility. In a clinical context, a relatively spared medial temporal lobe in the presence of posterior parietal atrophy may imply PCA, and should not discount AD. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

The cellular diversity of the brain necessitates a cellular resolution approach towards understanding the functional genomics of the nervous system. We describe here an anatomically comprehensive digital atlas containing the expression patterns of approximately 20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain. Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.},

abstract = {The stereotyped spatial architecture of the brain is both beautiful and fundamentally related to its function, extending from gross morphology to individual neuron types, where soma position, dendritic architecture, and axonal projections determine their roles in functional circuitry. Our understanding of the cell types that make up the brain is rapidly accelerating, driven in particular by recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics. However, understanding brain function, development, and disease will require linking molecular cell types to morphological, physiological, and behavioral correlates. Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomic methods promise to fill this gap by localizing molecularly defined cell types in tissues, with simultaneous detection of morphology, activity, or connectivity. Here, we review the requirements for spatial transcriptomic methods toward these goals, consider the challenges ahead, and describe promising applications.},

abstract = {The presence of the ɛ4 allele in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) represents the most important genetic risk factor for late onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), together with age and mid-life hypercholesterolemia. ApoE4 is the most important lipid transporter between cells in the CNS and it was found that ApoE4 is involved in Amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) formation, fibrilisation, accumulation, in the aggregation and hyperphosphorylation of tau and in the metabolism of brain cholesterol and in neurodegeneration. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A$\beta$1-42 is a marker of A$\beta$ plaque load in the brain. High CSF t-tau and p-tau concentrations reflect axonal and neuronal damage and injury, which correlates with a neurofibrillary tangle stage and load, also reflecting the intensity of the disease process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain atrophy is a biomarker of neurodegeneration and is the result of loss of neurons, synapses and dendritic arborization. ApoE genotype interacts with the AD biomarkers: ɛ4 carriers were found to present with lower concentrations of A$\beta$1-42, higher tau and p-tau, higher tau/A$\beta$ ratio and a higher degree of brain atrophy at any disease stage, changing the test performances and the ability to distinguish between the different cognitive condition. The presence of the ɛ4 allele was also found to increase the power to predict further cognitive decline. Even if the presence of ApoE4 is not a deterministic factor for AD, it seems to shift the progression of the disease towards a younger age and faster progression. It is also likely that the ɛ4 allele increases the intensity of the pathological process in several ways. In the study of cognitive impaired patients and in their follow-up, biomarkers should be interpreted in consideration of the ApoE genotype in order to better predict the progression of the disease.},

The principal topic of investigation is whether the thickness of one area of the cortex changes in a statistically correlated fashion with changes in thickness of other cortical regions. We further extend these methods by introducing techniques to test whether different population groupings exhibit significantly varying MACACC patterns. The methods are described in detail and applied to a normal childhood development population (n = 292), and show that association cortices have the highest correlation strengths. Taking Brodmann Area (BA) 44 as a seed region revealed MACACC patterns strikingly similar to tractography maps obtained from diffusion tensor imaging. Furthermore, the MACACC map of BA 44 changed with age, older subjects featuring tighter correlations with BA 44 in the anterior portions of the superior temporal gyri. Lastly, IQ-dependent MACACC differences were investigated, revealing steeper correlations between BA 44 and multiple frontal and parietal regions for the higher IQ group, most significantly (t = 4.0) in the anterior cingulate.},

abstract = {The logistic transformation, originally suggested by Johnson (1949), is applied to analyze responses that are restricted to a finite interval (e.g. (0,1)), so-called bounded outcome scores. Bounded outcome scores often have a non-standard distribution, e.g. J- or U-shaped, precluding classical parametric statistical approaches for analysis. Applying the logistic transformation on a normally distributed random variable, gives rise to a logit-normal (LN) distribution. This distribution can take a variety of shapes on (0,1). Further, the model can be extended to correct for (baseline) covariates. Therefore, the method could be useful for comparative clinical trials. Bounded outcomes can be found in many research areas, e.g. drug compliance research, quality-of-life studies, and pain (and pain relief) studies using visual analog scores, but all these scores can attain the boundary values 0 or 1. A natural extension of the above approach is therefore to assume a latent score on 0,1) having a LN distribution. Two cases are considered: (a) the bounded outcome score is a proportion where the true probabilities have a LN distribution on (0,1) and (b) the bounded outcome score on [0,1] is a coarsened version of a latent score with a LN distribution on (0,1). We also allow the variance (on the transformed scale) to depend on treatment. The usefulness of our approach for comparative clinical trials will be assessed in this paper. It turns out to be important to distinguish the case of equal and unequal variances. For a bounded outcome score of the second type and with equal variances, our approach comes close to ordinal probit (OP) regression. However, ignoring the inequality of variances can lead to highly biased parameter estimates. A simulation study compares the performance of our approach with the two-sample Wilcoxon test and with OP regression. Finally, the different methods are illustrated on two data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Lesion-deficit-based structure-function analysis has traditionally been empirical and nonquantitative. Our purpose was to establish a new brain image database (BRAID) that allows the statistical correlation of brain functional measures with anatomic lesions revealed by clinical brain images. METHODS Data on 303 participants in the MR Feasibility Study of the Cardiovascular Health Study were tested for lesion/deficit correlations. Functional data were derived from a limited neurologic examination performed at the time of the MR examination. Image data included 3D lesion descriptions derived from the MR examinations by hand segmentation. MR images were normalized in-plane using local, linear Talairach normalization. A database was implemented to support spatial data structures and associated geometric and statistical operations. The database stored the segmented lesions, patient functional scores, and several anatomic atlases. Lesion-deficit association was sought by contingency testing (chi2-test) for every possible combination of each neurologic variable and each labeled atlas structure. Significant associations that confirmed accepted lesion-deficit relationships were sought. RESULTS Two-hundred thirty-five infarctlike lesions in 117 subjects were viewed collectively after mapping into Talairach cartesian coordinates. Anatomic structures most strongly correlated with neurologic deficits tended to be situated in anatomically appropriate areas. For example, infarctlike lesions associated with visual field defects were correlated with structures in contralateral occipital structures, including the optic radiations and occipital gyri. CONCLUSION Known lesion-deficit correlations can be established by a database using a standard coordinate system for representing spatial data and incorporating functional and structural data together with appropriate query mechanisms. Improvements and further applications of this methodology may provide a powerful technique for uncovering new structure-function relationships.},

abstract = {Lewy-related pathology (LRP) is a common pathologic finding at autopsy in dementia patients. Recently criteria for categorizing types of LRP in dementia patients were published, though these criteria have yet to be systematically applied to large dementia samples. We examined a large (n = 208) referral-based autopsy sample for LRP, and applied the published criteria for LRP categorization to these cases. We found almost half (49%) of LRP positive cases from this sample were not classifiable. However, modifying the published criteria by reducing the number of regions requiring examination, allowing more variability in LRP severity scores within specific brain regions, and adding an amygdala predominant category permitted classification of 97% of LRP positive cases from the referral-based sample. Application of the modified criteria to an unrelated community-based autopsy sample (n = 226) allowed classification of 96% of LRP positive cases. Modest modifications in the published criteria permit a significantly greater number of dementia cases with LRP to be classified. In addition, this modification allows for more limited sampling of brain regions for classification of LRP. We propose that these modified criteria for the categorization of LRP be utilized in patients with a history of dementia.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need to develop molecular biomarkers of brain age in order to advance our understanding of age related neurodegeneration. Recently, we developed a highly accurate epigenetic biomarker of tissue age (known as epigenetic clock) which is based on DNA methylation levels. Here we use n=700 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples from Caucasian subjects of the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine the association between epigenetic age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) related cognitive decline, and AD related neuropathological markers. Epigenetic age acceleration of DLPFC is correlated with several neuropathological measurements including diffuse plaques (r=0.12, p=0.0015), neuritic plaques (r=0.11, p=0.0036), and amyloid load (r=0.091, p=0.016). Further, it is associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning ($\beta$=-0.500, p=0.009), episodic memory ($\beta$=-0.411, p=0.009) and working memory ($\beta$=-0.405, p=0.011) among individuals with AD. The neuropathological markers may mediate the association between epigenetic age and cognitive decline. Genetic complex trait analysis (GCTA) revealed that epigenetic age acceleration is heritable (h2=0.41) and has significant genetic correlations with diffuse plaques (r=0.24, p=0.010) and possibly working memory (r=-0.35, p=0.065). Overall, these results suggest that the epigenetic clock may lend itself as a molecular biomarker of brain age.},

We delineated and compared the longitudinal pattern of these PD-related changes. Structural MRIs and clinical measures were obtained from 76 PD with different disease durations and 70 Controls at baseline, 18-, and 36 months. Both cortical and subcortical (putamen, caudate, and globus pallidus) GM volumes were obtained, compared, and associated with PD clinical measures at baseline. Their volumes and rates of change also were compared among Controls, PDs, and PD subgroups based on duration of illness [≤1 year (PD(E)), 1-5 years (PD(M)), and >5 years (PD(L))]. Compared to Controls, PD subjects displayed smaller cortical GM and striatal(putamen, caudate, ps ≤0.001), volumes at baseline. Cortical GM volumes were negatively associated with disease duration at baseline, whereas striatal volumes were not. PD subjects demonstrated accelerated volume loss in cortical GM (p = 0.006), putamen (p = 0.034), and caudate (p = 0.008) compared to Controls. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that accelerated cortical atrophy reached statistical significance in PD subjects with duration of illness 1-5 years (PD(M), ps<0.001) and the trend of accelerated atrophy seemed to persist until later stages, whereas striatal atrophy occurred in PD subjects with PD(E) (p = 0.021 for putamen, p = 0.005 for caudate) and PD(M) (p = 0.002 for putamen, p = 0.001 for caudate) that significantly slowed down in PD(L) (ps for PD(L) vs PD(E) or PD(M): <0.01). The pattern of GM loss in PD differs in cortical and subcortical regions, with striatal atrophy occurring earlier and extra-striatal cortical atrophy later.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impairment of declarative memory coincides with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) and intraneuronal tau aggregates. Dementia severity correlates with decreased synapse density in hippocampus and cortex. Although numerous studies show that soluble Abeta oligomers inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation, their role in long-term synaptic depression (LTD) remains unclear. Here, we report that soluble Abeta oligomers from several sources (synthetic, cell culture, human brain extracts) facilitated electrically evoked LTD in the CA1 region. Abeta-enhanced LTD was mediated by mGluR or NMDAR activity. Both forms of LTD were prevented by an extracellular glutamate scavenger system. Abeta-facilitated LTD was mimicked by the glutamate reuptake inhibitor TBOA, including a shared dependence on extracellular calcium levels and activation of PP2B and GSK-3 signaling. In accord, synaptic glutamate uptake was significantly decreased by soluble Abeta. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers perturb synaptic plasticity by altering glutamate recycling at the synapse and promoting synapse depression.},

Numerous studies report that hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) can be inhibited by soluble oligomers of amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$), but the synaptic elements that mediate this effect remain unclear. We examined field EPSPs and whole-cell recordings in wild-type mouse hippocampal slices. Soluble A$\beta$ oligomers from three distinct sources (cultured cells, AD cortex, or synthetic peptide) inhibited LTP, and this was prevented by the selective NR2B inhibitors ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981. Soluble A$\beta$ enhanced NR2B-mediated NMDA currents and extrasynaptic responses; these effects were mimicked by the glutamate reuptake inhibitor dl-threo-$\beta$-benzyloxyaspartic acid. Downstream, an A$\beta$-mediated rise in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was followed by downregulation of cAMP response element-binding protein, and LTP impairment was prevented by inhibitors of p38 MAPK or calpain. Thus, soluble A$\beta$ oligomers at low nanomolar levels present in AD brain increase activation of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease exhibit perceptual deficits in odour identification, often before the appearance of overt memory loss. This impairment coincides with the initial accumulation of pathological lesions in limbic olfactory brain regions. Although these data imply that odour stimuli may be effectively used as biological probes of limbic dysfunction, the precise neural mechanisms underlying the olfactory deficits in early Alzheimer's disease remain poorly understood. In the current study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with an olfactory cross-adaptation paradigm to test the hypothesis that perceptual codes of odour quality in posterior piriform cortex are degraded in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In elderly control subjects, sequential presentation of qualitatively similar (versus qualitatively different) odourant pairs elicited cross-adapting responses in posterior piriform cortex, in accord with the pattern observed in healthy young adults. However, this profile was significantly blunted in patients with Alzheimer's disease, reflecting a functional disruption of odour quality coding in this olfactory brain area. These results highlight the potential of olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging as a non-invasive bioassay of limbic functional integrity, and suggest that such an index could possibly aid in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, as a putative lesion model of odour quality processing in the human brain, our study suggests a causal role of posterior piriform cortex in differentiating olfactory objects.},

Understanding the organization of the cholinergic system requires a complete map of cholinergic neurons and their axon arborizations throughout the entire brain at the level of single neurons. Here, we report a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of the cholinergic system originating from various cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Using genetically labeled cholinergic neurons together with whole-brain reconstruction of optical images at 2-$\mu$m resolution, we obtained quantification of the number and soma volume of cholinergic neurons in 22 brain areas. Furthermore, by reconstructing the complete axonal arbors of fluorescently labeled single neurons from a subregion of the basal forebrain at 1-$\mu$m resolution, we found that their projections to the forebrain and midbrain showed neuronal subgroups with distinct projection specificity and diverse arbor distribution within the same projection area. These results suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of cholinergic neurons that serve different regulatory functions in the brain and illustrate the usefulness of complete reconstruction of neuronal distribution and axon projections at the mesoscopic level.},

abstract = {Missorting of Tau from axons to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms underlying normal sorting and pathological failure are poorly understood. Here, we used several Tau constructs labelled with photoconvertible Dendra2 to analyse its mobility in polarized neurons. This revealed a novel mechanism of sorting-a retrograde barrier in the axon initial segment (AIS) operating as cellular rectifier. It allows anterograde flow of axonal Tau but prevents retrograde flow back into soma and dendrites. The barrier requires binding of Tau to microtubules but does not require F-actin and thus is distinct from the sorting of membrane-associated proteins at the AIS. The barrier breaks down when Tau is phosphorylated in its repeat domain and detached from microtubules, for example, by the kinase MARK/Par1. These observations link the pathological hallmarks of Tau missorting and hyperphosphorylation in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Non-Gaussian (anomalous) diffusion is wide spread in biological tissues where its effects modulate chemical reactions and membrane transport. When viewed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), anomalous diffusion is characterized by a persistent or 'long tail' behavior in the decay of the diffusion signal. Recent MRI studies have used the fractional derivative to describe diffusion dynamics in normal and post-mortem tissue by connecting the order of the derivative with changes in tissue composition, structure and complexity. In this study we consider an alternative approach by introducing fractal time and space derivatives into Fick's second law of diffusion. This provides a more natural way to link sub-voxel tissue composition with the observed MRI diffusion signal decay following the application of a diffusion-sensitive pulse sequence. Unlike previous studies using fractional order derivatives, here the fractal derivative order is directly connected to the Hausdorff fractal dimension of the diffusion trajectory. The result is a simpler, computationally faster, and more direct way to incorporate tissue complexity and microstructure into the diffusional dynamics. Furthermore, the results are readily expressed in terms of spectral entropy, which provides a quantitative measure of the overall complexity of the heterogeneous and multi-scale structure of biological tissues. As an example, we apply this new model for the characterization of diffusion in fixed samples of the mouse brain. These results are compared with those obtained using the mono-exponential, the stretched exponential, the fractional derivative, and the diffusion kurtosis models. Overall, we find that the order of the fractal time derivative, the diffusion coefficient, and the spectral entropy are potential biomarkers to differentiate between the microstructure of white and gray matter. In addition, we note that the fractal derivative model has practical advantages over the existing models from the perspective of computational accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies suggest that increased intake of the omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). DHA levels are lower in serum and brains of AD patients, which could result from low dietary intake and/or PUFA oxidation. Because effects of DHA on Alzheimer pathogenesis, particularly on amyloidosis, are unknown, we used the APPsw (Tg2576) transgenic mouse model to evaluate the impact of dietary DHA on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid burden. Aged animals (17-19 months old) were placed in one of three groups until 22.5 months of age: control (0.09% DHA), low-DHA (0%), or high-DHA (0.6%) chow. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) ELISA of the detergent-insoluble extract of cortical homogenates showed that DHA-enriched diets significantly reduced total Abeta by >70% when compared with low-DHA or control chow diets. Dietary DHA also decreased Abeta42 levels below those seen with control chow. Image analysis of brain sections with an antibody against Abeta (amino acids 1-13) revealed that overall plaque burden was significantly reduced by 40.3%, with the largest reductions (40-50%) in the hippocampus and parietal cortex. DHA modulated APP processing by decreasing both alpha- and beta-APP C-terminal fragment products and full-length APP. BACE1 (beta-secretase activity of the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme), ApoE (apolipoprotein E), and transthyretin gene expression were unchanged with the high-DHA diet. Together, these results suggest that dietary DHA could be protective against beta-amyloid production, accumulation, and potential downstream toxicity.},

abstract = {Tau aggregation is a hallmark feature in a subset of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Early and selective loss of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) is observed in patients with sporadic behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), including FTLD with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). Recently, we further showed that these specialized neurons show preferential aggregation of TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP. Whether VENs and fork cells are prone to tau accumulation in FTLD-tau remains unclear, and no previous studies of these neurons have focused on patients with pathogenic variants in the gene encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-tau/ MAPT ). Here, we examined regional profiles of tau aggregation and neurodegeneration in 40 brain regions in 8 patients with FTLD-tau/ MAPT and 7 with Pick's disease (PiD), a sporadic form of FTLD-tau that often presents with bvFTD. We further qualitatively assessed the cellular patterns of frontoinsular tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/ MAPT using antibodies specific for tau hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, or conformational change. ACC and mid-insula were among the regions most affected by neurodegeneration and tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/ MAPT and PiD. In these two forms of FTLD-tau, severity of regional neurodegeneration and tau protein aggregation were highly correlated across regions. In FTLD-tau/ MAPT , VENs and fork cells showed disproportionate tau protein aggregation in patients with V337 M, A152T, and IVS10 + 16 variants, but not in patients with the P301L variant. As seen in FTLD-TDP, our data suggest that VENs and fork cells represent preferentially vulnerable neuron types in most, but not all of the MAPT variants we studied.},

abstract = {SEE KOBYLECKI AND MANN DOI101093/AWW267 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: Animal models have shown that tau seeding and propagation are strain- and neural network-specific. The study of preclinical cases is valuable to gain insights into early pathological features of corticobasal degeneration and its progression. Three preclinical corticobasal degeneration cases and six age-matched end-stage corticobasal degeneration cases were included in this study. Tau immunohistochemistry performed in 20 brain regions and quantitative assessment of regional tau load using image analysis were performed. Semi-quantitative grading of tau-positive cellular lesions and neuronal loss in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices, striatum, substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus were assessed. All preclinical cases were clinically asymptomatic but had widespread tau lesions in the typically affected regions in corticobasal degeneration and the pathognomonic astrocytic plaques were the most prominent lesion type in the anterior frontal and striatal regions. Mean total tau load (sum of all regional tau load) of end-stage corticobasal degeneration cases were nine times greater than that of the preclinical cases (P = 0.04) and less tau load was found in all regions of the preclinical cases. An anterior-to-posterior tau load ratio in the frontal cortex in preclinical cases was 12-fold greater than in end-stage corticobasal degeneration cases. Relatively greater tau burden in the anterior frontal cortex, striatum and subthalamic nucleus suggests the striatal afferent connection to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia circuitry are the earliest neural network connections affected by corticobasal degeneration-related tau pathology. Differential distribution of the tau pathology to selective cortical regions in these preclinical cases implies phenotypic presentation may be predetermined at a very early stage of the disease process. Neuronal loss of the substantia nigra was either absent or very mild in the preclinical cases and was moderate to severe in end-stage corticobasal degeneration cases (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that a threshold of pathological burden in the 'right' anatomical regions needs to be reached before the onset of clinical symptoms. The early prominence of the astrocytic plaques in relation to sparse neuronal lesions leads one to speculate that corticobasal degeneration may begin as an astrogliopathy at a very early disease stage but neuronal lesions gradually take over as the predominant lesion type in advanced disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that the pathological effects of apoE4, the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), start many years before the onset of the disease and are already detectable at a young age. In the present study we investigated the extent to which such pathological and cognitive impairments also occur in young apoE4 mice. RESULTS: This study revealed that the levels of the presynaptic glutamatergic vesicular transporter, VGlut, in the CA3, CA1, and DG hippocampal subfields were lower in hippocampal neurons of young (4-month-old) apoE4-targeted replacement mice than in those of the apoE3 mice. In contrast, the corresponding inhibitory GABAergic nerve terminals and perikarya were not affected by apoE4.This synaptic effect was associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau in these neurons. In addition, apoE4 increased the accumulation of neuronal Abeta42 and induced mitochondrial changes, both of which were specifically pronounced in CA3 neurons. Spatial navigation behavioral studies revealed that these hippocampal pathological effects of apoE4 are associated with corresponding behavioral impairments. Time-course studies revealed that the effects of apoE4 on tau hyperphosphorylation and the mitochondria were already apparent at the age of 1 month and that the apoE4-driven accumulation of neuronal Abeta and reduced VGlut levels evolve later and are apparent at the age of 2-4 months. Furthermore, the levels of tau phosphorylation decrease in apoE3 mice and increase in apoE4 mice between 1 and 4 months, whereas the levels of Abeta42 decrease in apoE3 mice and are not affected in apoE4 mice over the same time period. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that apoE4 stimulates the accumulation of Abeta42 and hyperphosphorylated tau and reduces the levels of VGlut in hippocampal neurons of young apoE4-targeted replacement mice and that these neurochemical effects are associated with cognitive impairments. This model is not associated with hypothesis-driven mechanistic manipulations and is thus most suitable for unbiased studies of the mechanisms underlying the pathological effects of apoE4.},

To test whether pathology initiating in the EC spreads through the brain along synaptically connected circuits, we have generated a transgenic mouse model that differentially expresses pathological human tau in the EC and we have examined the distribution of tau pathology at different timepoints. In relatively young mice (10-11 months old), human tau was present in some cell bodies, but it was mostly observed in axons within the superficial layers of the medial and lateral EC, and at the terminal zones of the perforant pathway. In old mice (>22 months old), intense human tau immunoreactivity was readily detected not only in neurons in the superficial layers of the EC, but also in the subiculum, a substantial number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons especially in CA1, and in dentate gyrus granule cells. Scattered immunoreactive neurons were also seen in the deeper layers of the EC and in perirhinal and secondary somatosensory cortex. Immunoreactivity with the conformation-specific tau antibody MC1 correlated with the accumulation of argyrophilic material seen in old, but not young mice. In old mice, axonal human tau immunoreactivity, especially at the endzones of the perforant pathway, was greatly reduced. Relocalization of tau from axons to somatodendritic compartments and propagation of tauopathy to regions outside of the EC correlated with mature tangle formation in neurons in the EC as revealed by thioflavin-S staining. Our data demonstrate propagation of pathology from the EC and support a trans-synaptic mechanism of spread along anatomically connected networks, between connected and vulnerable neurons. In general, the mouse recapitulates the tauopathy that defines the early stages of AD and provides a model for testing mechanisms and functional outcomes associated with disease progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) project systematically profiles three-dimensional high-resolution gene expression in postnatal mouse brains for thousands of genes. By unveiling gene behaviors at both the cellular and molecular levels, ABA is becoming a unique and comprehensive neuroscience data source for decoding enigmatic biological processes in the brain. Given the unprecedented volume and complexity of the in situ hybridization image data, data mining in this area is extremely challenging. Currently, the ABA database mainly serves as an online reference for visual inspection of individual genes; the underlying rich information of this large data set is yet to be explored by novel computational tools. In this proof-of-concept study, we studied the hypothesis that genes sharing similar three-dimensional expression profiles in the mouse brain are likely to share similar biological functions. RESULTS: In order to address the pattern comparison challenge when analyzing the ABA database, we developed a robust image filtering method, dubbed histogram-row-column (HRC) algorithm. We demonstrated how the HRC algorithm offers the sensitivity of identifying a manageable number of gene pairs based on automatic pattern searching from an original large brain image collection. This tool enables us to quickly identify genes of similar in situ hybridization patterns in a semi-automatic fashion and consequently allows us to discover several gene expression patterns with expression neighborhoods containing genes of similar functional categories. CONCLUSION: Given a query brain image, HRC is a fully automated algorithm that is able to quickly mine vast number of brain images and identify a manageable subset of genes that potentially shares similar spatial co-distribution patterns for further visual inspection. A three-dimensional in situ hybridization pattern, if statistically significant, could serve as a fingerprint of certain gene function. Databases such as ABA provide valuable data source for characterizing brain-related gene functions when armed with powerful image querying tools like HRC.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposits are frequently surrounded by activated microglia but the precise role of these cells in disease progression remains unclear. The chemokine receptor CX3CR1 is selectively expressed in microglia and is thought to modulate their activity. To study the specific effects of microglia activation on amyloid pathology in vivo, we crossbred mice lacking CX3CR1 with the Alzheimer's mouse model CRND8. Surprisingly, we found that CX3CR1-deficient mice had lower brain levels of A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 and reduced amyloid deposits. Quantification of A$\beta$ within microglia and time-lapse two-photon microscopy in live mice revealed that these cells were highly effective at the uptake of protofibrillar amyloid but were incapable of phagocytosis of fibrillar congophilic A$\beta$. CX3CR1 deletion was associated with increased phagocytic ability, which led to greater amyloid content within microglial phagolysosomes. Furthermore, CX3CR1-deficient mice had an increased number of microglia around individual plaques because of higher proliferative rates, which likely contributed to an overall greater phagocytic capacity. CX3CR1 deletion did not affect the degree of neuronal or synaptic damage around plaques despite increased microglia density. Our results demonstrate that microglia can regulate brain A$\beta$ levels and plaque deposition via selective protofibrillar A$\beta$ phagocytosis. Modulation of microglia activity and proliferation by CX3CR1 signaling may represent a therapeutic strategy for AD.},

abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown that the decline of cognitive and memory functions is accompanied by a disrupted neuronal connectivity characterized by white matter (WM) degeneration. However, changes in the topological organization of WM structural network in AD remain largely unknown. Here, we used diffusion tensor image tractography to construct the human brain WM networks of 25 AD patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, followed by a graph theoretical analysis. We found that both AD patients and controls had a small-world topology in WM network, suggesting an optimal balance between structurally segregated and integrative organization. More important, the AD patients exhibited increased shortest path length and decreased global efficiency in WM network compared with controls, implying abnormal topological organization. Furthermore, we showed that the WM network contained highly connected hub regions that were predominately located in the precuneus, cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was consistent with the previous diffusion-MRI studies. Specifically, AD patients were found to have reduced nodal efficiency predominantly located in the frontal regions. Finally, we showed that the alterations of various network properties were significantly correlated with the behavior performances. Together, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the Alzheimer's brain was associated with disrupted topological organization in the large-scale WM structural networks, thus providing the structural evidence for abnormalities of systematic integrity in this disease. This work could also have implications for understanding how the abnormalities of structural connectivity in AD underlie behavioral deficits in the patients.},

abstract = {The expression of several members of the FOX gene family is known to be altered in a variety of cancers. We show that in breast cancer, FOXF1 gene is a target of epigenetic inactivation and that its gene product exhibits tumor-suppressive properties. Loss or downregulation of FOXF1 expression is associated with FOXF1 promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer cell lines and in invasive ductal carcinomas. Methylation of FOXF1 in invasive ductal carcinoma (37.6% of 117 cases) correlated with high tumor grade. Pharmacologic unmasking of epigenetic silencing in breast cancer cells restored FOXF1 expression. Re-expression of FOXF1 in breast cancer cells with epigenetically silenced FOXF1 genes led to G1 arrest concurrent with or without apoptosis to suppress both in vitro cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. FOXF1-induced G1 arrest resulted from a blockage at G1-S transition of the cell cycle through inhibition of the CDK2-RB-E2F cascade. Small interfering RNA–mediated depletion of FOXF1 in breast cancer cells led to increased DNA re-replication, suggesting that FOXF1 is required for maintaining the stringency of DNA replication and genomic stability. Furthermore, expression profiling of cell cycle regulatory genes showed that abrogation of FOXF1 function resulted in increased expression of E2F-induced genes involved in promoting the progression of S and G2 phases. Therefore, our studies have identified FOXF1 as a potential tumor suppressor gene that is epigenetically silenced in breast cancer, which plays an essential role in regulating cell cycle progression to maintain genomic stability.

abstract = {A graphical method of analysis applicable to ligands that bind reversibly to receptors or enzymes requiring the simultaneous measurement of plasma and tissue radioactivities for multiple times after the injection of a radiolabeled tracer is presented. It is shown that there is a time t† after which a plot of f t 0 ROI( t') dt'/ROI( t) versus f t 0 C p ( t') dt'/ROI( t) (where ROI and C p are functions of time describing the variation of tissue radioactivity and plasma radioactivity, respectively) is linear with a slope that corresponds to the steady-state space of the ligand plus the plasma volume, V p . For a two-compartment model, the slope is given by $\lambda$ + V p , where $\lambda$ is the partition coefficient and the intercept is −1/[ k 2 (1 + V p /$\lambda$)]. For a three-compartment model, the slope is $\lambda$(1 + B max / K d ) + V p and the intercept is −{(1 + B max / K d )/ k 2 + [ k off (1 + K d / B max )] −1 } [1 + V p /$\lambda$(1 + B max / K d )] −1 (where B max represents the concentration of ligand binding sites and K d the equilibrium dissociation constant of the ligand–binding site complex, k off ( k 4 ) the ligand–binding site dissociation constant, and k 2 is the transfer constant from tissue to plasma). This graphical method provides the ratio B max / K d from the slope for comparison with in vitro measures of the same parameter. It also provides an easy, rapid method for comparison of the reproducibility of repeated measures in a single subject, for longitudinal or drug intervention protocols, or for comparing experimental results between subjects. Although the linearity of this plot holds when ROI/ C p is constant, it can be shown that, for many systems, linearity is effectively reached some time before this. This analysis has been applied to data from [ N-methyl- 11 C]-(–)-cocaine ([ 11 C]cocaine) studies in normal human volunteers and the results are compared to the standard nonlinear least-squares analysis. The calculated value of B max / K d for the high-affinity binding site for cocaine is 0.62 ± 0.20, in agreement with literature values.},

abstract = {18F-MK-6240 is a highly selective, subnanomolar-affinity Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer for imaging neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Plasma kinetics, brain uptake, and preliminary quantitative analysis of 18F-MK-6240 in healthy elderly subjects (HE), subjects with clinically probable Alzheimer disease (AD), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were characterized in a first-in-human study. Methods: Dynamic PET scans of up to 150 min were performed in 4 cognitively normal HE, 4 AD and 2 MCI subjects, after bolus injection of 152-169 MBq 18F-MK-6240 to evaluate tracer kinetics and distribution in brain. Regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) were determined using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region. Total distribution volume (VT) was assessed by compartmental modeling using radiometabolite corrected input function in a subgroup of 6 subjects. Results:18F-MK-6240 had rapid brain uptake with peak standardized uptake value of 3-5, followed by a uniformly quick washout from all brain regions in HE; slower clearance was observed in regions commonly associated with NFT deposition in AD. In AD, SUVR measured between 60-90 min postinjection was high (approximately 2-4) in regions associated with NFT deposition; whereas, in HE, SUVR was approximately 1 across all brain regions suggesting high tracer selectivity for binding NFTs in vivo. 18F-MK-6240 VT was approximately 2- to 3-fold higher in neocortical and medial temporal brain regions of AD compared with HE, and stabilized by 60 min in both groups. DVR estimated by Logan reference tissue model or compartmental modeling correlated well (R2 >0.9) to SUVR60-90 min for AD. Conclusion:18F-MK-6240 exhibited favorable kinetics with high-binding levels to brain regions with a plausible pattern for NFT deposition in AD. In comparison, negligible tracer binding was observed in HE. This pilot study suggests simplified ratio methods such as SUVR can be employed to quantify NFT binding. These results support further clinical development of 18F-MK-6240 for potential application in longitudinal studies.},

In the mean-field limit, the spatially variable concentration of diffusing death factor is replaced by a constant average value. Recent empirical advances now permit the actual diffusion of such factors to be followed in intact neuropil. In this paper we therefore extend the model beyond the mean-field limit, to include the diffusion dynamics of death factor bursts released from dying neurons. A range of novel tissue degeneration patterns is observed, for which we confirm and extend the mean-field prediction that sigmoidal patterns of neuron population decay are a principal hallmark of cell death in the presence of death factor release.},

abstract = {See Herholz (doi:10.1093/brain/awx340) for a scientific commentary on this article.Autopsy data have proposed that a topographical pattern of tauopathy occurs in the brain with the development of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the findings of tau-PET to better understand neurofibrillary tangle development as it is seen in cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals. The evolution of Alzheimer's disease tauopathy in cognitively unimpaired individuals needs to be examined to better understand disease pathogenesis. Tau-PET was performed in 86 cognitively impaired individuals who all had abnormal amyloid levels and 601 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Tau-PET findings were assessed for relationships with clinical diagnosis, age, and regional uptake patterns relative to Braak stage. Regional and voxel-wise analyses were performed. Topographical findings from tau-PET were characterized using hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based subcategorization. In older cognitively unimpaired individuals (≥50 years), widespread, age-related elevated tau signal was seen among those with normal or abnormal amyloid status as compared to younger cognitively unimpaired individuals (30-49 years). More frequent regional tau signal elevation throughout the brain was seen in cognitively unimpaired individuals with abnormal versus normal amyloid. Elevated tau signal was seen in regions that are considered high Braak Stage in cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired individuals. Hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based categorizations both showed different patterns of tau signal between groups such as greater tau signal in frontal regions in younger onset Alzheimer's disease dementia participants (most of whom had a dysexecutive clinical presentation). Tau-PET signal increases modestly with age throughout the brain in cognitively unimpaired individuals and elevated tau is seen more often when amyloid brain accumulation is present. Tau signal patterns in cognitively unimpaired correspond to early Braak stage but also suggest tangle involvement in extra-medial temporal and extra-temporal regions that are considered more advanced in the Braak scheme even when amyloid negative. Our findings also suggest the possibility of widespread development of early tangle pathology rather than a pattern defined exclusively by adjacent, region-to-region spread, prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangle deposition in younger-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia versus older-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia provide evidence for variability in regional tangle deposition patterns and demonstrate that different disease phenotypes have different patterns of tauopathy. Pathological correlation with imaging is needed to assess the implications of these observations.},

However, the factors that trigger aggregation of $\alpha$-Synuclein ($\alpha$-Syn), the principal component of the intraneuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs), and Lewy neurites (LNs), which characterize Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with LBs (DLB), are poorly understood. We show here that in young asymptomatic $\alpha$-Syn transgenic (Tg) mice, intracerebral injections of brain homogenates derived from older Tg mice exhibiting $\alpha$-Syn pathology accelerate both the formation of intracellular LB/LN-like inclusions and the onset of neurological symptoms in recipient animals. Pathological $\alpha$-Syn propagated along major central nervous system (CNS) pathways to regions far beyond injection sites and reduced survival with a highly reproducible interval from injection to death in inoculated animals. Importantly, inoculation with $\alpha$-Syn amyloid fibrils assembled from recombinant human $\alpha$-Syn induced identical consequences. Furthermore, we show for the first time that synthetic $\alpha$-Syn fibrils are wholly sufficient to initiate PD-like LBs/LNs and to transmit disease in vivo. Thus, our data point to a prion-like cascade in synucleinopathies whereby cell–cell transmission and propagation of misfolded $\alpha$-Syn underlie the CNS spread of LBs/LNs. These findings open up new avenues for understanding the progression of PD and for developing novel therapeutics.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-Syn) neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic $\alpha$-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic $\alpha$-Syn and Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic $\alpha$-Syn and the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a sporadic, chronic neurodegenerative disease, usually occurring late in life. The last decade has witnessed tremendous advances in our understanding about the genetic basis of AD, but a large amount of the variance in disease risk remains to be explained. Epigenetic mechanisms, which developmentally regulate gene expression via modifications to DNA, histone proteins, and chromatin, have been hypothesized to play a role in other complex neurobiological diseases, and studies to identify genome-wide epigenetic changes in AD are currently under way. However, the simple brute-force approach that has been successfully employed in genome-wide association studies is unlikely to be successful in epigenome-wide association studies of neurodegeneration. A more academic approach to understanding the role of epigenetic variation in AD is required, with careful consideration of study design, methodological approaches, tissue-specificity, and causal inference. In this article, we review the empirical literature supporting a role for epigenetic processes in AD, and discuss important considerations and future directions for this new and emerging field of research. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

However, few studies have applied these methods to preclinical research. In this study, we present a fully automatic framework for mouse brain MRI structural parcellation using multi-atlas segmentation propagation. The framework adopts the similarity and truth estimation for propagated segmentations (STEPS) algorithm, which utilises a locally normalised cross correlation similarity metric for atlas selection and an extended simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) framework for multi-label fusion. The segmentation accuracy of the multi-atlas framework was evaluated using publicly available mouse brain atlas databases with pre-segmented manually labelled anatomical structures as the gold standard, and optimised parameters were obtained for the STEPS algorithm in the label fusion to achieve the best segmentation accuracy. We showed that our multi-atlas framework resulted in significantly higher segmentation accuracy compared to single-atlas based segmentation, as well as to the original STAPLE framework.},

abstract = {A comprehensive three-dimensional digital atlas database of the C57BL/6J mouse brain was developed based on magnetic resonance microscopy images acquired on a 17.6-T superconducting magnet. By using both manual tracing and an atlas-based semi-automatic segmentation approach, T2*-weighted magnetic resonance microscopy images of 10 adult male formalin-fixed, excised C57BL/6J mouse brains were segmented into 20 anatomical structures. These structures included the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulbs, basal forebrain and septum, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray, superior colliculi, inferior colliculi, the rest of midbrain, cerebellum, brainstem, corpus callosum/external capsule, internal capsule, anterior commissure, fimbria, and ventricles. The segmentation data were formatted and stored into a database containing three different atlas types: 10 single-specimen brain atlases, an average brain atlas and a probabilistic atlas. Additionally, quantitative group information, such as variations in structural volume, surface area, magnetic resonance microscopy image intensity and local geometry, were computed and stored as an integral part of the database. The database augments ongoing efforts with other high priority strains as defined by the Mouse Phenome Database focused on providing a quantitative framework for accurate mapping of functional, genetic and protein expression patterns acquired by a myriad of technologies and imaging modalities. {\textcopyright} 2005 IBRO.

The V(T) values estimated using ICA-IF were more reliable than CS-IF for all brain regions. Specifically, the slope regression in the frontal cortex with ICA-IF was r² = 0.91 (p<0.05), and r² = 0.71 (p<0.05) using CS-IF.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate basal ganglia changes along the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-ALS- frontotemporal dementia (FTD) continuum using multiple, complementary imaging techniques. Methods: Sixty-seven C9orf72-negative patients with ALS and 39 healthy controls were included in a cross-sectional quantitative MRI study. Seven patients with ALS met criteria for comorbid behavioral variant FTD (ALS-FTD), 18 patients met the Strong criteria for cognitive and/ or behavioral impairment (ALS-Plus), and 42 patients had no cognitive impairment (ALS-Nci). Volumetric, shape, and density analyses were performed for the thalamus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, pallidum, and putamen. Results: Significant basal ganglia volume differences were identified between the study groups. Shape analysis revealed distinct atrophy patterns in the amygdala in patients with ALS-Nci and in the hippocampus in patients with ALS-Plus in comparison with controls. Patients with ALSFTD exhibited pathologic changes in the bilateral thalami, putamina, pallida, hippocampi, caudate, and accumbens nuclei in comparison with all other study groups. A preferential vulnerability has been identified within basal ganglia subregions, which connect directly to key cortical sites of ALS pathology. While the anatomical patterns were analogous, the degree of volumetric, shape, and density changes confirmed incremental pathology through the spectrum of ALS-Nci, ALS-Plus, to ALS-FTD. Performance on verbal memory tests correlated with hippocampal volumes, and accumbens nuclei volumes showed a negative correlation with apathy scores. Conclusions: We demonstrate correlations between basal ganglia measures and structurespecific neuropsychological performance and a gradient of incremental basal ganglia pathology across the ALS-ALS-FTD spectrum, suggesting that the degree of subcortical gray matter pathology in C9orf72-negative ALS is closely associated with neuropsychological changes.},

abstract = {There is enormous clinical value in inferring the brain regions initially atrophied in Parkinson disease for individual patients and understanding its relationship with clinical and genetic risk factors. The aim of this study is to leverage a new seed-inference algorithm demonstrated for Alzheimer's disease to the Parkinsonian context and to cluster patients in meaningful subgroups based on these incipient atrophy patterns. Instead of testing brain regions separately as the likely initiation site for each patient, we solve an L1-penalized optimization problem that can return a more predictive heterogeneous, multi-locus seed patterns. A cluster analysis of the individual seed patterns reveals two distinct subgroups (S1 versus S2). The S1 subgroup is characterized by the involvement of the brainstem and ventral nuclei, and S2 by cortex and striatum. Post hoc analysis in features not included in the clustering shows significant differences between subgroups regarding age of onset and local transcriptional patterns of Parkinson-related genes. Top genes associated with regional microglial abundance are strongly associated with subgroup S1 but not with S2. Our results suggest two distinct aetiological mechanisms operative in Parkinson disease. The interplay between immune-related genes, lysosomal genes, microglial abundance and atrophy initiation sites may explain why the age of onset for patients in S1 is on average 4.5 years later than for those in S2. We highlight and compare the most prominently affected brain regions for both subgroups. Altogether, our findings may improve current screening strategies for early Parkinson onsetters.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the magnitude of the correlations between disability and composite MRI scores in patients with MS. METHODS: T2- and T1-weighted MRI, magnetization transfer imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and MRS imaging scans of the brain from 23 patients with MS were obtained. T2 lesion volume, T1 lesion volume, brain magnetization transfer ratio, average brain diffusivity (D), and brain N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio were measured. RESULTS: The correlations between the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and each of the MR quantities taken in isolation were not significant, with the exception of the correlation between EDSS and the NAA/creatine ratio (r = -0.50; p = 0.01). In contrast, three of the composite MR scores computed using regression models were strongly correlated with the EDSS scores (r range, 0.58 to 0.73; p range, 0.004 to 0.0001). The model that included T2 and T1 lesion volumes and brain D explained 34% of the EDSS variance; the model that included T2 and T1 lesion volumes and brain N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio explained 36% of the EDSS variance; the model that included T1 lesion volume, brain D, and brain N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio explained 53% of the EDSS variance.

abstract = {The transmissible agent of prion disease consists of prion protein (PrP) in $\beta$-sheet-rich state (PrP(Sc)) that can replicate its conformation according to a template-assisted mechanism. This mechanism postulates that the folding pattern of a newly recruited polypeptide accurately reproduces that of the PrP(Sc) template. Here, three conformationally distinct amyloid states were prepared in vitro using Syrian hamster recombinant PrP (rPrP) in the absence of cellular cofactors. Surprisingly, no signs of prion infection were found in Syrian hamsters inoculated with rPrP fibrils that resembled PrP(Sc), whereas an alternative amyloid state, with a folding pattern different from that of PrP(Sc), induced a pathogenic process that led to transmissible prion disease. An atypical proteinase K-resistant, transmissible PrP form that resembled the structure of the amyloid seeds was observed during a clinically silent stage before authentic PrP(Sc) emerged. The dynamics between the two forms suggest that atypical proteinase K-resistant PrP (PrPres) gave rise to PrP(Sc). While no PrP(Sc) was found in preparations of fibrils using protein misfolding cyclic amplification with beads (PMCAb), rPrP fibrils gave rise to atypical PrPres in modified PMCAb, suggesting that atypical PrPres was the first product of PrP(C) misfolding triggered by fibrils. The current work demonstrates that a new mechanism responsible for prion diseases different from the PrP(Sc)-templated or spontaneous conversion of PrP(C) into PrP(Sc) exists. This study provides compelling evidence that noninfectious amyloids with a structure different from that of PrP(Sc) could lead to transmissible prion disease. This work has numerous implications for understanding the etiology of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn). The mechanism by which $\alpha$-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds $\alpha$-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the $\alpha$-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. $\alpha$-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated $\alpha$-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed $\alpha$-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds $\alpha$-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related $\alpha$-synucleinopathies.},

abstract = {Pathological aggregation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. We have previously shown that the deficiency of the microglial fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) led to the acceleration of tau pathology and memory impairment in an hTau mouse model of tauopathy. Here, we show that microglia drive tau pathology in a cell-autonomous manner. First, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation occur as early as 2 months of age in hTauCx3cr1(-/-) mice. Second, CD45(+) microglial activation correlates with the spatial memory deficit and spread of tau pathology in the anatomically connected regions of the hippocampus. Third, adoptive transfer of purified microglia derived from hTauCx3cr1(-/-) mice induces tau hyperphosphorylation within the brains of non-transgenic recipient mice. Finally, inclusion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (Kineret{\textregistered}) in the adoptive transfer inoculum significantly reduces microglia-induced tau pathology. Together, our results suggest that reactive microglia are sufficient to drive tau pathology and correlate with the spread of pathological tau in the brain.},

abstract = {Reliable and well-validated biomarkers for PD to identify individuals "at risk" before motor symptoms, accurately diagnose individuals at the threshold of clinical PD, and monitor PD progression throughout its course would dramatically accelerate research into both PD cause and therapeutics. Biomarkers offer the potential to provide a window onto disease mechanism, potentially generating therapeutic targets for disease. In particular, biomarkers enable investigation of the premotor period of PD before typical symptoms are manifest, but while degeneration has already begun. Given the multiple genetic causes for PD already identified, the marked variability in the loss of dopaminergic markers measured by imaging at motor symptom onset and the clear heterogeneity of clinical symptoms in PD onset and clinical progression, it is likely many biomarkers with a focus ranging from clinical symptoms to PD pathobiology to molecular genetic mechanisms will be necessary to fully map PD risk and progression. Biomarkers are also critical in new drug development for PD, both in early validation studies to assess drug dosing and to determine drug penetrance into the brain, and in later efficacy studies to complement PD clinical outcomes. During the past two decades, much progress has been made in identifying and assessing PD biomarkers, but as yet, no fully validated biomarker for PD is currently available. Nonetheless, there is increasing evidence that molecular genetics, focused -omic (proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic) assessment of blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and advanced in vivo brain imaging will provide critical clues to assist in the diagnosis and medical management of PD patients.},

abstract = {Gene expression fundamentally shapes the structural and functional architecture of the human brain. Open-access transcriptomic datasets like the Allen Human Brain Atlas provide an unprecedented ability to examine these mechanisms in vivo; however, a lack of standardization across research groups has given rise to myriad processing pipelines for using these data. Here, we develop the abagen toolbox, an open-access software package for working with transcriptomic data, and use it to examine how methodological variability influences the outcomes of research using the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Applying three prototypical analyses to the outputs of 750,000 unique processing pipelines, we find that choice of pipeline has a large impact on research findings, with parameters commonly varied in the literature influencing correlations between derived gene expression and other imaging phenotypes by as much as $\rho$ ≥ 1.0. Our results further reveal an ordering of parameter importance, with processing steps that influence gene normalization yielding the greatest impact on downstream statistical inferences and conclusions. The presented work and the development of the abagen toolbox lay the foundation for more standardized and systematic research in imaging transcriptomics, and will help to advance future understanding of the influence of gene expression in the human brain.},

abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson's disease present with a complex clinical phenotype, encompassing sleep, motor, cognitive, and affective disturbances. However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson's disease from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia and cognitive impairment associated with aging are a major medical and social concern. Neuropsychological testing is a key element in the diagnostic procedures of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), but has presently a limited value in the prediction of progression to dementia. We advance the hypothesis that newer statistical classification methods derived from data mining and machine learning methods like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests can improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of predictions obtained from neuropsychological testing. Seven non parametric classifiers derived from data mining methods (Multilayer Perceptrons Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, CART, CHAID and QUEST Classification Trees and Random Forests) were compared to three traditional classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression) in terms of overall classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, Area under the ROC curve and Press'Q. Model predictors were 10 neuropsychological tests currently used in the diagnosis of dementia. Statistical distributions of classification parameters obtained from a 5-fold cross-validation were compared using the Friedman's nonparametric test. RESULTS: Press' Q test showed that all classifiers performed better than chance alone (p < 0.05). Support Vector Machines showed the larger overall classification accuracy (Median (Me) = 0.76) an area under the ROC (Me = 0.90). However this method showed high specificity (Me = 1.0) but low sensitivity (Me = 0.3). Random Forest ranked second in overall accuracy (Me = 0.73) with high area under the ROC (Me = 0.73) specificity (Me = 0.73) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). Linear Discriminant Analysis also showed acceptable overall accuracy (Me = 0.66), with acceptable area under the ROC (Me = 0.72) specificity (Me = 0.66) and sensitivity (Me = 0.64). The remaining classifiers showed overall classification accuracy above a median value of 0.63, but for most sensitivity was around or even lower than a median value of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: When taking into account sensitivity, specificity and overall classification accuracy Random Forests and Linear Discriminant analysis rank first among all the classifiers tested in prediction of dementia using several neuropsychological tests. These methods may be used to improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of Dementia predictions from neuropsychological testing.},

abstract = {Lewy bodies (LBs) are complex, intracellular inclusions that are common pathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases. They consist largely of aggregated forms of the protein alpha-Synuclein ($\alpha$-Syn), which misfolds to give rise to beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. The aggregation of monomers into fibrils occurs readily in vitro and pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) generated from recombinant $\alpha$-Syn monomers are the basis of many models of LB diseases. These $\alpha$-Syn PFFs recapitulate many pathological phenotypes in both cultured cells and animal models including the formation of $\alpha$-Syn rich, insoluble aggregates, neuron loss, and motor deficits. However, it is not clear how closely $\alpha$-Syn PFFs recapitulate the biological behavior of LB aggregates isolated directly from patients. Direct interrogation of the cellular response to LB-derived $\alpha$-Syn has thus far been limited. Here we demonstrate that $\alpha$-Syn aggregates derived from LB disease patients induce pathology characterized by a prevalence of large somatic inclusions that is distinct from the primarily neuritic pathology induced by $\alpha$-Syn PFFs in our cultured neuron model. Moreover, these LB-derived aggregates can be amplified in vitro using recombinant $\alpha$-Syn to generate aggregates that maintain the unique, somatic pathological phenotype of the original material. Amplified LB aggregates also showed greater uptake in cultured neurons and greater pathological burden and more rapid pathological spread in injected mouse brains, compared to $\alpha$-Syn PFFs. Our work indicates that LB-derived $\alpha$-Syn from diseased brains represents a distinct conformation species with unique biological activities that has not been previously observed in fully recombinant $\alpha$-Syn aggregates and demonstrate a new strategy for improving upon $\alpha$-Syn PFF models of synucleinopathies using amplified LBs.},

Methods We applied [F-18]-AV-1451 phosphor screen autoradiography, [F-18]-AV-1451 nuclear emulsion autoradiography, and [H-3]-AV-1451 in vitro binding assays to the study of postmortem samples from patients with a definite pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and elderly controls free of pathology. Results Our data suggest that [F-18]-AV-1451 strongly binds to tau lesions primarily made of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer brains (eg, intraneuronal and extraneuronal tangles and dystrophic neurites), but does not seem to bind to a significant extent to neuronal and glial inclusions mainly composed of straight tau filaments in non-Alzheimer tauopathy brains or to lesions containing $\beta$-amyloid, $\alpha$-synuclein, or TDP-43. [F-18]-AV-1451 off-target binding to neuromelanin- and melanin-containing cells and, to a lesser extent, to brain hemorrhagic lesions was identified. Interpretation Our data suggest that [F-18]-AV-1451 holds promise as a surrogate marker for the detection of brain tau pathology in the form of tangles and paired helical filament-tau-containing neurites in Alzheimer brains but also point to its relatively lower affinity for lesions primarily made of straight tau filaments in non-Alzheimer tauopathy cases and to the existence of some [F-18]-AV-1451 off-target binding. These findings provide important insights for interpreting in vivo patterns of [F-18]-AV-1451 retention.},

abstract = {Using alpha-synuclein-immunohistochemistry, 27 brains of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were investigated to identify the progression of Lewy pathology including Lewy bodies (LB) and LB-related neurites in the cerebrum. The numbers of alpha-synuclein-positive LB and LB-related neurites were semiquantitatively evaluated in the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, transentorhinal cortex, insular cortex, middle temporal cortex and superior frontal cortex. The results indicated that Lewy pathology within the neuron progresses first in the axonal terminal, subsequently in the cell body and finally in the dendrite, that Lewy pathology in the cerebral cortex progresses first in layers V-VI, subsequently in layer III and finally in layer II, and that Lewy pathology in the cerebrum progresses first in the amygdala, subsequently in the limbic cortex and finally in the neocortex. In addition, Lewy pathology was graded from stage I to stage IV based on the progression of Lewy pathology. The 27 brains examined were classified into 3 brains showing stage I, 11 showing stage II, 7 showing stage III and 6 showing stage IV. Comparing these stages with the pathological subtypes of DLB brains, brains of the subtype showing severe Alzheimer pathology corresponded to brains showing an advanced stage, suggesting that Alzheimer pathology exacerbates Lewy pathology.},

abstract = {Research on cognitive aging has focused on how decline in various cortical and hippocampal regions influence cognition. However, brainstem regions play essential modulatory roles, and new evidence suggests that, among these, the integrity of the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system plays a key role in determining late-life cognitive abilities. The LC is especially vulnerable to toxins and infection and is often the first place Alzheimer's-related pathology appears, with most people showing at least some tau pathology by their mid-20s. On the other hand, NE released from the LC during arousing, mentally challenging, or novel situations helps to protect neurons from damage, which may help to explain how education and engaging careers prevent cognitive decline in later years.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and survival rates of total and cause specific dementia in a general Japanese population. METHODS: A total of 828 subjects without dementia, aged 65 years or over, were followed-up prospectively for 17 years. Dementia was subdivided into cause specific subtypes: namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), combined dementia and other types of dementia. During the follow-up, 275 subjects developed dementia; of these, 251 (91.2%) were evaluated morphologically, with 164 subjected to brain autopsy examination and the remaining 87 to neuroimaging. RESULTS: The incidences of total dementia, AD, VD, DLB, combined dementia and other types of dementia were 32.3 (n = 275), 14.6 (124), 9.5 (81), 1.4 (12), 3.8 (33), and 3.1 (16) per 1000 person years, respectively. The incidences of AD, combined dementia and other types of dementia rose with increasing age, particularly after the age of 85 years, but this tendency was not observed for VD or DLB. The survival curve of dementia cases aged 65-89 years was significantly lower than that of age and sex matched controls (10 year survival rate, 13.6% vs 29.3%; hazard ratio 1.67; 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.13). The 10 year survival rates were not significantly different among dementia subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Japanese elderly population has a high risk for the development of dementia, specifically AD and VD, and once dementia is established, the risk of death is considerable.},

Aside from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) $\beta$-amyloid42 (A$\beta$42) and tau, no studies have tested associations between CSF proteins and AD-like brain atrophy. We studied 90 healthy elders, who underwent lumbar puncture at baseline, and serial magnetic resonance imaging scans for up to 4 years. We tested statistical effects of baseline CSF proteins (N = 70 proteins related to A$\beta$42-metabolism, microglial activity, and synaptic/neuronal function) on atrophy rates in 7 AD-related regions. Besides the effects of A$\beta$42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) that were seen in several regions, novel CSF proteins were found to have effects in inferior and middle temporal cortex (including apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein D, and apolipoprotein H). Several proteins (including S100$\beta$ and matrix metalloproteinase-3) had effects that depended on the presence of brain A$\beta$ pathology, as measured by CSF A$\beta$42. Other proteins (including P-tau and apolipoprotein D) had effects even after adjusting for CSF A$\beta$42. The statistical effects in this exploratory study were mild and not significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but some of the identified proteins may be associated with brain atrophy in healthy persons. Proteins interacting with CSF A$\beta$42 may be related to A$\beta$ brain pathology, whereas proteins associated with atrophy even after adjusting for CSF A$\beta$42 may be related to A$\beta$-independent mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) $\alpha$-synuclein is reduced in synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies, and some studies have found increased CSF $\alpha$-synuclein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). No study has explored effects of CSF $\alpha$-synuclein on brain atrophy. Here we tested if baseline CSF $\alpha$-synuclein affects brain atrophy rates and if these effects vary across brain regions, and across the cognitive spectrum from healthy elders (NL), to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS Baseline CSF $\alpha$-synuclein measurements and longitudinal structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 74 NL, 118 MCI patients and 55 AD patients. Effects of baseline CSF $\alpha$-synuclein on regional atrophy rates were tested in 1) four pre-hoc defined regions possibly associated with Lewy body and/or AD pathology (amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, brainstem), and 2) all available regions of interest. Differences across diagnoses were tested by assessing the interaction of CSF $\alpha$-synuclein and diagnosis (testing NL versus MCI, and NL versus AD). RESULTS The effects of CSF $\alpha$-synuclein on longitudinal atrophy rates were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. There were tendencies for effects in AD in caudate (higher atrophy rates in subjects with higher CSF $\alpha$-synuclein, P=0.046) and brainstem (higher atrophy rates in subjects with lower CSF $\alpha$-synuclein, P=0.063). CSF $\alpha$-synuclein had significantly different effects on atrophy rates in NL and AD in brainstem (P=0.037) and caudate (P=0.006). DISCUSSION With the possible exception of caudate and brainstem, the overall weak effects of CSF $\alpha$-synuclein on atrophy rates in NL, MCI and AD argues against CSF $\alpha$-synuclein as a biomarker related to longitudinal brain atrophy in these diagnostic groups. Any effects of CSF $\alpha$-synuclein may be attenuated by possible simultaneous occurrence of AD-related neuronal injury and concomitant Lewy body pathology, which may elevate and reduce CSF $\alpha$-synuclein levels, respectively.},

The concept has been used extensively as a potential way of explaining differences in degeneration patterns and the clinical presentation of different neurodegenerative diseases. Yet the increasing complexity of molecular histopathology at the cellular level in neurodegenerative disorders frequently appears at odds with phenotyping based on clinically-directed, macroscopic regional brain involvement. While cross-disease comparisons can provide insights into the differential vulnerability of networks and neuronal populations, we focus here on what is known about selective vulnerability-related factors that might explain the differential phenotypic expressions of the same disease-in this case, typical and atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease. Whereas considerable progress has been made in this area, much is yet to be elucidated; further studies comparing different phenotypic variants aimed at identifying both vulnerability and resilience factors may provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, and suggest novel targets for therapy.},

abstract = {Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia among older adults, yet more than a century of research has not determined why this disease develops. One prevailing hypothesis is that late-onset AD is caused by infectious pathogens, an idea widely studied in both humans and experimental animal models. This review examines the infectious AD etiology hypothesis and summarizes existing evidence associating infectious agents with AD in humans. The various mechanisms through which different clinical and subclinical infections could cause or promote the progression of AD are considered, as is the concordance between putative infectious agents and the epidemiology of AD. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for research articles pertaining to infections and AD and systematically reviewed the evidence linking specific infectious pathogens to AD. The evidence compiled from the literature linking AD to an infectious cause is inconclusive, but the amount of evidence suggestive of an association is too substantial to ignore. Epidemiologic, clinical, and basic science studies that could improve on current understanding of the associations between AD and infections and possibly uncover ways to control this highly prevalent and debilitating disease are suggested.},

A DTI index of WM integrity, fractional anisotropy (FA), was calculated in 14 patients with probable mild AD, 14 participants with MCI and 21 elderly healthy controls (NC). Voxel-by-voxel comparisons showed significant regional reductions of FA in participants with MCI and AD compared to controls in multiple posterior white matter regions. Moreover, there was substantial overlap of locations of regional decrease in FA in the MCI and AD groups.

abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several related disorders collectively known as tauopathies. Development of tau pathology is associated with progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline. In the brains of AD patients, tau pathology spreads following an anatomically defined pattern. Mounting evidence strongly suggests that accumulation of abnormal tau is mediated through spreading of seeds of the protein from cell to cell and point at the involvement of extracellular tau species as the main agent in the interneuronal propagation of neurofibrillary lesions and spreading of tau toxicity throughout different brain regions in these disorders. That would support the concept that pathology initiates in a very small part of the brain many years before becoming symptomatic, spreading progressively to the whole brain within 10-20 years. Understanding the precise molecular mechanism underlying tau propagation is crucial for the development of therapeutics for this devastating disorder. In this work, we will discuss recent research on the role of extracellular tau in the spreading of tau pathology, through synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Medina and Avila.},

abstract = {Although much has been learned about the functional organization of the human brain through lesion-deficit analysis, the variety of statistical and image-processing methods developed for this purpose precludes a closed-form analysis of the statistical power of these systems. Therefore, we developed a lesion-deficit simulator (LDS), which generates artificial subjects, each of which consists of a set of functional deficits, and a brain image with lesions; the deficits and lesions conform to predefined distributions. We used probability distributions to model the number, sizes, and spatial distribution of lesions, to model the structure-function associations, and to model registration error. We used the LDS to evaluate, as examples, the effects of the complexities and strengths of lesion-deficit associations, and of registration error, on the power of lesion-deficit analysis. We measured the numbers of recovered associations from these simulated data, as a function of the number of subjects analyzed, the strengths and number of associations in the statistical model, the number of structures associated with a particular function, and the prior probabilities of structures being abnormal. The number of subjects required to recover the simulated lesion-deficit associations was found to have an inverse relationship to the strength of associations, and to the smallest probability in the structure-function model. The number of structures associated with a particular function (i.e., the complexity of associations) had a much greater effect on the performance of the analysis method than did the total number of associations. We also found that registration error of 5 mm or less reduces the number of associations discovered by approximately 13% compared to perfect registration.

abstract = {Objective: Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging-based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS-associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression. Methods: Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network-based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets. Results: We observe that computer-simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients. Interpretation: Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738.},

abstract = {Age-related neurodegenerative disease has been mechanistically linked with mitochondrial dysfunction via damage from reactive oxygen species produced within the cell. We determined whether increased mitochondrial oxidative stress could modulate or regulate two of the key neurochemical hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): tau phosphorylation, and beta-amyloid deposition. Mice lacking superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) die within the first week of life, and develop a complex heterogeneous phenotype arising from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Treatment of these mice with catalytic antioxidants increases their lifespan and rescues the peripheral phenotypes, while uncovering central nervous system pathology. We examined sod2 null mice differentially treated with high and low doses of a catalytic antioxidant and observed striking elevations in the levels of tau phosphorylation (at Ser-396 and other phospho-epitopes of tau) in the low-dose antioxidant treated mice at AD-associated residues. This hyperphosphorylation of tau was prevented with an increased dose of the antioxidant, previously reported to be sufficient to prevent neuropathology. We then genetically combined a well-characterized mouse model of AD (Tg2576) with heterozygous sod2 knockout mice to study the interactions between mitochondrial oxidative stress and cerebral Ass load. We found that mitochondrial SOD2 deficiency exacerbates amyloid burden and significantly reduces metal levels in the brain, while increasing levels of Ser-396 phosphorylated tau. These findings mechanistically link mitochondrial oxidative stress with the pathological features of AD.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to i) identify substantia nigra subregions i.e. pars reticulata (SNr) and pars compacta (SNc), in human, and ii) to assess volumetric changes in these subregions in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Current MR imaging techniques are unable to distinguish SNr and SNc. Segmentation of these regions may be clinically useful in Parkinson's disease (PD) as substantia nigra is invariably affected in PD. We acquired quantitative T1 as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from ten healthy subjects and ten PD patients. For each subject, the left and right SN were manually outlined on T1 images and then classified into two discrete regions based on the characteristics of their connectivity with the rest of the brain using an automated clustering method on the DTI data. We identified two regions in each subjects' SN: an internal region that is likely to correspond with SNc because it was mainly connected with posterior striatum, pallidum, anterior thalamus, and prefrontal cortex; and an external region that correspond with SNr because it was chiefly connected with posterior thalamus, ventral thalamus, and motor cortex. Volumetric study of these regions in PD patients showed a general atrophy in PD particularly in the right SNr. This pilot study showed that automated DTI-based parcellation of SN subregions may provide a useful tool for in-vivo identification of SNc and SNr and might therefore assist to detect changes that occur in patients with PD.},

abstract = {The substantia nigra contains dopaminergic cells that project to the striatum and are affected by the neurodegenerative process that appears in Parkinson's disease (PD). For accurate differential diagnosis and for disease monitoring the availability of a sensitive and non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease would be essential. Although there has been notable progress in studying correlates of nigral degeneration by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past decade, MRI and analysis techniques that allow accurate high-resolution mapping of the SN within a clinically acceptable acquisition time are still elusive. The main purpose of the preliminary study was to evaluate the potential role of the driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 (DESPOT1) method for delineation of the SN and differentiation of PD patients from healthy control subjects (n=10 in each group). We also investigated whether additional measures that can be obtained with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can further improve the MRI-guided discrimination between PD patients and controls. Our results show that the DESPOT1 method allows for a clear visualisation of the SN as a whole. Volumetric comparisons between ten PD patients and ten healthy subjects revealed significantly smaller volumes in patients for both the left and the right sides when the whole SN was considered. Combining SN volumetry and its connectivity with the thalamus improved the classification sensitivity to 100% and specificity to 80% for PD (discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross validation). Combining DESPOT1 imaging and DTI could therefore serve as a diagnostic marker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the future.},

abstract = {This is the concluding article in a series of 3 studies that investigate the anatomical determinants of thalamocortical (TC) input to excitatory neurons in a cortical column of rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We used viral synaptophysin-enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in thalamic neurons and reconstructions of biocytin-labeled cortical neurons in TC slices to quantify the number and distribution of boutons from the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and posteromedial (POm) nuclei potentially innervating dendritic arbors of excitatory neurons located in layers (L)2-6 of a cortical column in rat somatosensory cortex. We found that 1) all types of excitatory neurons potentially receive substantial TC input (90-580 boutons per neuron); 2) pyramidal neurons in L3-L6 receive dual TC input from both VPM and POm that is potentially of equal magnitude for thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons (ca. 300 boutons each from VPM and POm); 3) L3, L4, and L5 pyramidal neurons have multiple (2-4) subcellular TC innervation domains that match the dendritic compartments of pyramidal cells; and 4) a subtype of thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons has an additional VPM innervation domain in L4. The multiple subcellular TC innervation domains of L5 pyramidal neurons may partly explain their specific action potential patterns observed in vivo. We conclude that the substantial potential TC innervation of all excitatory neuron types in a cortical column constitutes an anatomical basis for the initial near-simultaneous representation of a sensory stimulus in different neuron types. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2010.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal tau pathology progression is regarded as highly stereotyped within each type of degenerative condition. For instance, AD has a progression of tau pathology consistently beginning in the entorhinal cortex, the locus coeruleus, and other nearby noradrenergic brainstem nuclei, before spreading to the rest of the limbic system as well as the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. Proposed explanations for the consistent spatial patterns of tau pathology progression, as well as for why certain regions are selectively vulnerable to exhibiting pathology over the course of disease generally focus on transsynaptic spread proceeding via the brain's anatomic connectivity network in a cell-independent manner or on cell-intrinsic properties that might render some cell populations or regions uniquely vulnerable. We test connectivity based explanations of spatiotemporal tau pathology progression and regional vulnerability against cell-intrinsic explanation, using regional gene expression profiles as a proxy. We find that across both exogenously seeded and non-seeded tauopathic mouse models, the connectivity network provides a better explanation than regional gene expression profiles, even when such profiles are limited to specific sets of tau risk-related genes only. Our results suggest that, regardless of the location of pathology initiation, tau pathology progression is well characterized by a model positing entirely cell-type and molecular environment independent transsynaptic spread via the mouse brain's connectivity network. These results further suggest that regional vulnerability to tau pathology is mainly governed by connectivity with regions already exhibiting pathology, rather than by cell-intrinsic factors.},

We examine tauopathy and connectome interactions to investigate why different spatiotemporal patterns of pathology arise. Methods: We test whether divergent spatiotemporal tau pathology patterns from 15 mouse-model datasets can be explained by a directional bias in tau transmission along fiber tracts via a mathematical model called Directed Network Transmission (DNT). Results: Amyloid-comorbid tauopathic mouse models meant to mimic AD demonstrate spatiotemporal tauopathy patterns consistent with retrograde direction spread biases. Non-amyloid-comorbid mice demonstrate no consistent spread biases. Further, canonically ‘early' tau pathology regions in AD are implicated as having earliest pathology in a simulation with random tauopathy seeding locations with retrograde biased spread. Discussion: These results implicate directional biases in tau pathology spread along fiber tracts as a strong candidate explanation for divergent spatiotemporal tau progression between conditions.},

abstract = {In Parkinson's disease, some of the first alpha-synuclein aggregates appear in the olfactory system and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve before spreading to connected brain regions. We previously demonstrated that injection of alpha-synuclein fibrils unilaterally into the olfactory bulb of wild type mice leads to widespread synucleinopathy in brain regions directly and indirectly connected to the injection site, consistently, over the course of periods longer than 6 months. Our previously reported observations support the idea that alpha-synuclein inclusions propagates between brain region through neuronal networks. In the present study, we further defined the pattern of propagation of alpha-synuclein inclusions and developed a mathematical model based on known mouse brain connectivity. Using this model, we first predicted the pattern of alpha-synuclein inclusions propagation following an injection of fibrils into the olfactory bulb. We then analyzed the fitting of these predictions to our published histological data. Our results demonstrate that the pattern of propagation we observed in vivo is consistent with axonal transport of alpha-synuclein aggregate seeds, followed by transsynaptic transmission. By contrast, simple diffusion of alpha-synuclein fits very poorly our in vivo data. We also found that the spread of alpha-synuclein inclusions appeared to primarily follow neural connections retrogradely until 9 months after injection into the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, the pattern of spreading was consistent with anterograde propagation mathematical models. Finally, we applied our mathematical model to a different, previously published, dataset involving alpha-synuclein fibril injections into the striatum, instead of the olfactory bulb. We found that the mathematical model accurately predicts the reported progressive increase in alpha-synuclein neuropathology also in that paradigm. In conclusion, our findings support that the progressive spread of alpha-synuclein inclusions after injection of protein fibrils follows neural networks in the mouse connectome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recent evidence from neuropsychologic and neuroimaging studies suggests that central nervous system involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) extends beyond motor neurons. Our purpose was to obtain measures of global and regional atrophy in nondemented patients with ALS to assess subtle structural brain changes. METHODS MR images, acquired from 16 patients and 9 healthy subjects (HS), were processed by using the Structural Imaging Evaluation of Normalized Atrophy (SIENA) software to estimate whole-brain atrophy measures and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to highlight the selective volumetric decrease of single cerebral areas. In addition, each subject underwent a neuropsychologic examination. RESULTS In patients with ALS, brain parenchymal fraction was slightly lower compared with HS (P = .012), and seemed to be related to the presence of cognitive impairment. Patients showed a gray matter volume decrease in several frontal and temporal areas bilaterally (P < .001 uncorrected) compared with HS, with a slight prevalence in the right hemisphere. No volume reduction in primary motor cortices of patients was detected. Performances on Symbol Digit Modalities Test were significantly worse in patients compared with HS (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS The presence of mild whole-brain volume loss and regional frontotemporal atrophy in patients with ALS could explain the presence of cognitive impairment and confirms the idea of ALS as a degenerative brain disease not confined to motor system.},

abstract = {We propose a method that combines signals from many brain regions observed in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to predict the subject's behavior during a scanning session. Such predictions suffer from the huge number of brain regions sampled on the voxel grid of standard fMRI data sets: the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is thus needed, but it is often performed using a univariate feature selection procedure, that handles neither the spatial structure of the images, nor the multivariate nature of the signal. By introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume that incorporates connectivity constraints, we reduce the span of the possible spatial configurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We then prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised clustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such that parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information. Dimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the constructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal. Comparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that our approach yields higher prediction accuracy than standard voxel-based approaches. Moreover, the method infers an explicit weighting of the regions involved in the regression or classification task.},

abstract = {Recent technological advancements have enabled spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling but at multi-cellular pixel resolution, thereby hindering the identification of cell-type-specific spatial patterns and gene expression variation. To address this challenge, we develop STdeconvolve as a reference-free approach to deconvolve underlying cell types comprising such multi-cellular pixel resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets. Using simulated as well as real ST datasets from diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies comprising a variety of spatial resolutions such as Spatial Transcriptomics, 10X Visium, DBiT-seq, and Slide-seq, we show that STdeconvolve can effectively recover cell-type transcriptional profiles and their proportional representation within pixels without reliance on external single-cell transcriptomics references. STdeconvolve provides comparable performance to existing reference-based methods when suitable single-cell references are available, as well as potentially superior performance when suitable single-cell references are not available. STdeconvolve is available as an open-source R software package with the source code available at https://github.com/JEFworks-Lab/STdeconvolve .},

abstract = {Because mouse models play a crucial role in biomedical research related to the human nervous system, understanding the similarities and differences between mouse and human brain is of fundamental importance. Studies comparing transcription in human and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain disorders.},

@article{Mintun1984,
abstract = {We propose an in vivo method for use with positron emission tomography (PET) that results in a quantitative characterization of neuroleptic binding sites using radiolabeled spiperone. The data are analyzed using a mathematical model that describes transport, nonspecific binding, and specific binding in the brain. The model demonstrates that the receptor quantities Bmax (i.e., the number of binding sites) and KD-1 (i.e., the binding affinity) are not separably ascertainable with tracer methodology in human subjects. We have, therefore, introduced a new term, the binding potential, equivalent to the product BmaxKD-1, which reflects the capacity of a given tissue, or region of a tissue, for ligand-binding site interaction. The procedure for obtaining these measurements is illustrated with data from sequential PET scans of baboons after intravenous injection of carrier-added [18F]spiperone. From these data we estimate the brain tissue nonspecific binding of spiperone to be in the range of 94.2 to 95.3%, and the regional brain spiperone permeability (measured as the permeability-surface area product) to be in the range of 0.025 to 0.036 cm3/(s X ml). The binding potential of the striatum ranged from 17.4 to 21.6; these in vivo estimates compare favorably to in vitro values in the literature. To our knowledge this represents the first direct evidence that PET can be used to characterize quantitatively, locally and in vivo, drug binding sites in brain. The ability to make such measurements with PET should permit the detailed investigation of diseases thought to result from disorders of receptor function.},

abstract = {Utilizing [18F]-AV-1451 tau positron emission tomography (PET) as an Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker will require identification of brain regions that are most important in detecting elevated tau pathology in preclinical AD. Here, we utilized an unsupervised learning, data-driven approach to identify brain regions whose tau PET is most informative in discriminating low and high levels of [18F]-AV-1451 binding. 84 cognitively normal participants who had undergone AV-1451 PET imaging were used in a sparse k-means clustering with resampling analysis to identify the regions most informative in dividing a cognitively normal population into high tau and low tau groups. The highest-weighted FreeSurfer regions of interest (ROIs) separating these groups were the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, lateral occipital cortex, and inferior temporal cortex, and an average SUVR in these four ROIs was used as a summary metric for AV-1451 uptake. We propose an AV-1451 SUVR cut-off of 1.25 to define high tau as described by imaging. This spatial distribution of tau PET is a more widespread pattern than that predicted by pathological staging schemes. Our data-derived metric was validated first in this cognitively normal cohort by correlating with early measures of cognitive dysfunction, and with disease progression as measured by $\beta$-amyloid PET imaging. We additionally validated this summary metric in a cohort of 13 Alzheimer disease patients, and showed that this measure correlates with cognitive dysfunction and $\beta$-amyloid PET imaging in a diseased population.},

abstract = {Increasingly detailed data on the network topology of neural circuits create a need for theoretical principles that explain how these networks shape neural communication. Here we use a model of cascade spreading to reveal architectural features of human brain networks that facilitate spreading. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we investigate scenarios where perturbations initiated at seed nodes result in global cascades that interact either cooperatively or competitively. We find that hub regions and a backbone of pathways facilitate early spreading, while the shortest path structure of the connectome enables cooperative effects, accelerating the spread of cascades. Finally, competing cascades become integrated by converging on polysensory associative areas. These findings show that the organizational principles of brain networks shape global communication and facilitate integrative function.},

MCI participants that converted to AD (average follow-up 15 months) displayed significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed using a pattern classifier previously constructed from AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality scores measured from MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas they were positive in almost all MCI converters (MCI-C), indicating extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C. Both MCI subgroups had similar MMSE scores at baseline. A more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification accuracy reaching 81.5%, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of AD and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual patient basis.},

Specifically, reactive astrocytes have both advantageous and adverse effects during neurodegeneration. The ability to isolate and depict astrocyte phenotype has been challenging. However, with the recent development of single-cell sequencing technologies researchers are provided with the resource to delineate specific biomarkers associated with reactive astrocytes in AD. In this review, we will focus on the role of astrocytes in normal conditions and the pathological development of AD. We will further review recent developments in the understanding of astrocyte heterogeneity and associated biomarkers.

abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is a common autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with early adult-onset motor abnormalities and dementia. Many studies of HD show that huntingtin (CAG)n repeat-expansion length is a sensitive and specific marker for HD. However, there are a significant number of examples of HD in the absence of a huntingtin (CAG)n expansion, suggesting that mutations in other genes can provoke HD-like disorders. The identification of genes responsible for these "phenocopies" may greatly improve the reliability of genetic screens for HD and may provide further insight into neurodegenerative disease. We have examined an HD phenocopy pedigree with linkage to chromosome 20p12 for mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). This reveals that affected individuals are heterozygous for a 192-nucleotide (nt) insertion within the PrP coding region, which encodes an expanded PrP with eight extra octapeptide repeats. This reveals that this HD phenocopy is, in fact, a familial prion disease and that PrP repeat-expansion mutations can provoke an HD "genocopy." PrP repeat expansions are well characterized and provoke early-onset, slowly progressive atypical prion diseases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a remarkable range of clinical features, many of which overlap with those of HD. This observation raises the possibility that an unknown number of HD phenocopies are, in fact, familial prion diseases and argues that clinicians should consider screening for PrP mutations in individuals with HD-like diseases in which the characteristic HD (CAG)n repeat expansions are absent.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

The molecular and cellular alterations that trigger this disease are still diffuse, one of the reasons for the delay in finding an effective treatment. In the search for new targets to search for novel therapeutic avenues, clinical studies in patients who used anti-inflammatory drugs indicating a lower incidence of AD have been of value to support the neuroinflammatory hypothesis of the neurodegenerative processes and the role of innate immunity in this disease. Neuroinflammation appears to occur as a consequence of a series of damage signals, including trauma, infection, oxidative agents, redox iron, oligomers of $\tau$ and $\beta$-amyloid, etc. In this context, our theory of Neuroimmunomodulation focus on the link between neuronal damage and brain inflammatory process, mediated by the progressive activation of astrocytes and microglial cells with the consequent overproduction of proinflammatory agents. Here, we discuss about the role of microglial and astrocytic cells, the principal agents in neuroinflammation process, in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. In this context, we also evaluated the potential relevance of natural anti-inflammatory components, which include curcumin and the novel Andean Compound, as agents for AD prevention and as a coadjuvant for AD treatments.},

However, electron microscopy experiments revealed diminished docked synaptic vesicles in oAbeta42-microinjected terminals, without affecting clathrin-coated vesicles. The molecular events of this modulation involved casein kinase 2 and the synaptic vesicle rapid endocytosis pathway. These findings open the possibility of a new therapeutic target aimed at ameliorating synaptic dysfunction in AD.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) promise a significant impact on the understanding of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) as the genetic components have been estimated to account for 60-80% of the disease. The recent publication of results from large GWAS suggests that LOAD is now one of the best-understood complex disorders. Four recent large LOAD GWAS have resulted in the identification of nine novel loci. These genes are CLU--clusterin, PICALM--phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein, CR1--complement receptor 1, BIN1--bridging integrator 1, ABCA7--ATP-binding cassette transporter, MS4A cluster--membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A, CD2AP--CD2-associated protein, CD33--sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin and EPHA1--ephrin receptor A1. Collectively, these genes now explain around 50% of LOAD genetics and map on to three new pathways linked to immune system function, cholesterol metabolism and synaptic cell membrane processes. These three new pathways are not strongly linked to the amyloid hypothesis that has driven so much recent thinking and open up avenues for intensive research with regard to the potential for therapeutic intervention.},

In HD, striking neuropathological changes occur in the striatum, including loss of medium spiny neurons and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons accompanied by neurodegeneration of the striosome and matrix compartments, leading to progressive impairment of reasoning, walking and speaking abilities. The precise cause of striatal pathology in HD is still unknown; however, accumulating clinical and experimental evidence suggests multiple plausible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying striatal neurodegeneration in HD. Here, we review and discuss the characteristic neurodegenerative patterns observed in the striatum of HD patients and consider the role of various huntingtin-related and striatum-enriched proteins in neurotoxicity and neuroprotection.},

There was a correlation between putamen influx (Ki) and clinical rating, but not symptom duration. In 11 patients with hemi-Parkinson's disease of recent onset there were significant differences between normal (mean 0.0123 (SD 0.0023)), asymptomatic (mean 0.0099 (0.0020)) and symptomatic (mean 0.0070 (00.014)) putamen Kis. This suggests that Parkinson's disease has a widely variable rate of progression, and is most compatible with a short preclinical period. Symptom onset was estimated at a putamen Ki of between 57% and 80% of normal. Most ipsilateral putamen Ki values in early asymmetric Parkinson's disease fell within the normal range. The implication is that either the disease is not established in the ipsilateral putamen or that the technique is insufficiently sensitive to detect it. Discriminant analysis completely separated the normal and Parkinson's disease cohorts, but when a discriminant function from a previous study was used predictively four of the 27 patients with Parkinson's disease were incorrectly classified as normal.},

However, when an adaptive immune response continues unchecked in the brain, the proinflammatory innate microglial response leads to the accumulation of neurotoxins and eventual neurodegeneration. What drives such responses are misfolded and nitrated proteins. Indeed, the antigen in Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aberrant self-protein, although the adaptive immune responses are remarkably similar in a range of diseases. Ingress of lymphocytes and chronic activation of glial cells directly affect neurodegeneration. With this understanding, new therapies aimed at modulating the immune system's response during PD could lead to decreased neuronal loss and improved clinical outcomes for disease.},

abstract = {Huntington's Disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in the gene encoding Huntingtin (Htt). It is characterized by chorea, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders. The most affected brain region is the striatum, and the clinical symptoms are directly correlated to the rate of striatal degeneration. The wild-type Htt is a ubiquitous protein and its deletion is lethal. Mutated (expanded) Htt produces excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunctions, axonal transport deficit, altered proteasome activity, and gene dysregulation. Transcriptional dysregulation occurs at early neuropathological stages in HD patients. Multiple genes are dysregulated, with overlaps of altered transcripts between mouse models of HD and patient brains. Nuclear localization of Exp-Htt interferes with transcription factors, co-activators, and proteins of the transcriptional machinery. Another key mechanism described so far, is an alteration of cytoplasmic retention of the transcriptional repressor REST, which is normally associated with wild-type Htt. As such, Exp-Htt causes alteration of transcription of multiple genes involved in neuronal survival, plasticity, signaling, and mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Besides these transcriptional dysregulations, Exp-Htt affects the chromatin structure through altered post-translational modifications (PTM) of histones and methylation of DNA. Multiple alterations of histone PTM are described, including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, polyamination, and phosphorylation. Exp-Htt also affects the expression and regulation of non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs). First multiple neural miRNAs are controlled by REST, and dysregulated in HD, with concomitant de-repression of downstream mRNA targets. Second, Exp-Htt protein or RNA may also play a major role in the processing of miRNAs and hence pathogenesis. These pleiotropic effects of Exp-Htt on gene expression may represent seminal deleterious effects in the pathogenesis of HD.},

abstract = {The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG expansion in $\sim$50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and periphery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Extrafocal structural abnormalities have been consistently described in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis (TLE-MTS). In TLE without MTS (TLE-no) extrafocal abnormalities are more subtle and often require region of interest analyses for their detection. Cortical thickness measurements might be better suited to detect such subtle abnormalities than conventional whole brain volumetric techniques which are often negative in TLE-no. The aim of this study was to seek and characterize patterns of cortical thinning in TLE-MTS and TLE-no. METHODS: T1 weighted whole brain images were acquired on a 4 T magnet in 66 subjects (35 controls, 15 TLE-MTS, 16 TLE-no). Cortical thickness measurements were obtained using the FreeSurfer software routine. Group comparisons and correlation analyses were done using the statistical routine of FreeSurfer (FDR, p=0.05). RESULTS: TLE-MTS and TLE-no showed both widespread temporal and extratemporal cortical thinning. In TLE-MTS, the inferior medial and posterior temporal regions were most prominently affected while lateral temporal and opercular regions were more affected in TLE-no. The correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between the ipsilateral hippocampal volume and regions of thinning in TLE-MTS and between inferior temporal cortical thickness and thinning in extratemporal cortical regions in TLE-no. CONCLUSION: The pattern of thinning in TLE-no was different from the pattern in TLE-MTS. This finding suggests that different epileptogenic networks could be involved in TLE-MTS and TLE and further supports the hypothesis that TLE-MTS and TLE-no might represent two distinct TLE syndromes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Histopathological studies and animal models suggest that hippocampal subfields may be differently affected by aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other diseases. High-resolution images at 4 Tesla depict details of the internal structure of the hippocampus allowing for in vivo volumetry of different subfields. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to determine patterns of volume loss in hippocampal subfields in normal aging, AD, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). (2) To determine if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal volume for differentiation between groups. METHODS:: Ninety-one subjects (53 controls (mean age: 69.3 ± 7.3), 20 MCI (mean age: 73.6 ± 7.1), and 18 AD (mean age: 69.1 ± 9.5) were studied with a high-resolution T2 weighted imaging sequence aimed at the hippocampus. Entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum, CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone (CA1-2), CA3 & dentate gyrus (CA3&DG) were manually marked in the anterior third of the hippocampal body. Hippocampal volume was obtained from the Freesurfer and manually edited. RESULTS:: Compared to controls, AD had smaller volumes of ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA1-2, and total hippocampal volumes. MCI had smaller CA1-2 volumes. Discriminant analysis and power analysis showed that CA1-2 was superior to total hippocampal volume for distinction between controls and MCI. CONCLUSION:: The patterns of subfield atrophy in AD and MCI were consistent with patterns of neuronal cell loss/reduced synaptic density described by histopathology. These preliminary findings suggest that hippocampal subfield volumetry might be a better measure for diagnosis of early AD and for detection of other disease effects than measurement of total hippocampus.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) noninvasively depicts white matter connectivity in regions where the Gaussian model of diffusion is valid but yields inaccurate results in those where diffusion has a more complex distribution, such as fiber crossings. q-ball imaging (QBI) overcomes this limitation of DTI by more fully characterizing the angular dependence of intravoxel diffusion with larger numbers of diffusion-encoding directional measurements at higher diffusion-weighting factors (b values). However, the former technique results in longer acquisition times and the latter technique results in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this project, we developed specialized 7-T acquisition methods utilizing novel radiofrequency pulses, eight-channel parallel imaging EPI and high-order shimming with a phase-sensitive multichannel B0 field map reconstruction. These methods were applied in initial healthy adult volunteer studies, which demonstrated the feasibility of performing 7-T QBI. Preliminary comparisons of 3 T with 7 T within supratentorial crossing white matter tracts documented a 79.5% SNR increase for b=3000 s/mm2 (P=.0001) and a 38.6% SNR increase for b=6000 s/mm2 (P=.015). With spherical harmonic reconstruction of the q-ball orientation distribution function at b=3000 s/mm2, 7-T QBI allowed for accurate visualization of crossing fiber tracts with fewer diffusion-encoding acquisitions as compared with 3-T QBI. The improvement of 7-T QBI at b factors as high as 6000 s/mm2 resulted in better angular resolution as compared with 3-T QBI for depicting fibers crossing at shallow angles. Although the increased susceptibility effects at 7 T caused problematic distortions near brain-air interfaces at the skull base and posterior fossa, these initial 7-T QBI studies demonstrated excellent quality in much of the supratentorial brain, with significant improvements as compared with 3-T acquisitions in the same individuals.},

abstract = {Deposition of proteins of aberrant conformation is the hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolding of the normally globular mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) is a central, early, but poorly understood event in the pathogenic cascade leading to familial forms of ALS. Here we report that aggregates composed of an ALS-causing SOD1 mutant penetrate inside cells by macropinocytosis and rapidly exit the macropinocytic compartment to nucleate aggregation of the cytosolic, otherwise soluble, mutant SOD1 protein. Once initiated, mutant SOD1 aggregation is self-perpetuating. Mutant SOD1 aggregates transfer from cell to cell with remarkable efficiency, a process that does not require contacts between cells but depends on the extracellular release of aggregates. This study reveals that SOD1 aggregates, propagate in a prion-like manner in neuronal cells and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying aggregate uptake and cell-to-cell transfer.},

abstract = {Entorhinal cortex (EC) relays information from the hippocampus to the cerebral cortex. The origin of this entorhino-cortical pathway was studied semiquantitatively and topographically with the use of 23 retrograde tracer injections in cortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of the monkey. To assess possible alternative, parallel pathways, the parahippocampal region, comprised of temporal pole (TP), perirhinal (PRC), and posterior parahippocampal cortices (PPH), was included in the study. The majority of the cortical areas receive convergent projections from EC and the parahippocampal region. Strong EC layer V output is directed to temporal pole, medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices, and the rostral part of the polysensory area of the superior temporal sulcus (sts). Moderate EC output is directed to the caudal superior temporal gyrus, area TE, and parietal cortex, and little to none to the lateral frontal cortex. With the exception of the projection to the medial frontal cortex, output from TP, PRC, and PPH surpassed that from EC, although with regional differences. TP layers II-III, V-VI project strongly to all areas injected except parietal cortex and caudal superior temporal gyrus, while PRC layers III/V-VI send strong projections to rostral parts of area TE and sts. PPH layers III/V-VI project heavily to parietal cortex and caudal superior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that the medial temporal output is primarily organized hierarchically, but at the same time, it has multiple exits of information. These parallel, alternative routes may influence local circuitry in the cerebral cortex and participate in the consolidation of declarative memory.},

A three-dimensional single-cell-resolution mammalian brain atlas will accelerate systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits underlying various brain functions. However, its construction requires efficient subcellular-resolution imaging throughout the entire brain. To address this challenge, we developed a fluorescent-protein-compatible, whole-organ clearing and homogeneous expansion protocol based on an aqueous chemical solution (CUBIC-X). The expanded, well-cleared brain enabled us to construct a point-based mouse brain atlas with single-cell annotation (CUBIC-Atlas). CUBIC-Atlas reflects inhomogeneous whole-brain development, revealing a significant decrease in the cerebral visual and somatosensory cortical areas during postnatal development. Probabilistic activity mapping of pharmacologically stimulated Arc-dVenus reporter mouse brains onto CUBIC-Atlas revealed the existence of distinct functional structures in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. CUBIC-Atlas is shareable by an open-source web-based viewer, providing a new platform for whole-brain cell profiling.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces memory and cognitive impairment in the absence of motor and sensory deficits during its early and middle course. A major unresolved question is the basis for this selective neuronal vulnerability. A$\beta$ which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, is generated throughout the brain, yet some regions outside of the limbic and cerebral cortices are relatively spared from A$\beta$ plaque deposition and synapse loss. Here, we examine neurons derived from iPSCs of patients harboring an amyloid precursor protein mutation to quantify AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to rostral fates of the brain (vulnerable) and caudal fates (relatively spared) in AD. We find that both the generation of A$\beta$ and the responsiveness of TAU to A$\beta$ are affected by neuronal cell type, with rostral neurons being more sensitive than caudal neurons. Thus, cell-autonomous factors may in part dictate the pattern of selective regional vulnerability in human neurons in AD. In this article, Muratore et al. examine differential vulnerability of neuronal subtypes in AD by directing iPSC lines from control and familial AD subjects to different regional neuronal fates. APP processing and TAU proteostasis are differentially affected between regional fates, such that neuronal cell type dictates generation of and responsiveness to A$\beta$.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Neurofibrillary pathology has a stereotypical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is encapsulated in the Braak staging scheme; however, some AD cases are atypical and do not fit into this scheme. We aimed to compare clinical and neuropathological features between typical and atypical AD cases. METHODS AD cases with a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage of more than IV were identified from a brain bank database. By use of thioflavin-S fluorescence microscopy, we assessed the density and the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in three cortical regions and two hippocampal sectors. These data were used to construct an algorithm to classify AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing, or limbic predominant. Classified cases were then compared for clinical, demographic, pathological, and genetic characteristics. An independent cohort of AD cases was assessed to validate findings from the initial cohort. FINDINGS 889 cases of AD, 398 men and 491 women with age at death of 37-103 years, were classified with the algorithm as hippocampal sparing (97 cases [11%]), typical (665 [75%]), or limbic predominant (127 [14%]). By comparison with typical AD, neurofibrillary tangle counts per 0.125 mm(2) in hippocampal sparing cases were higher in cortical areas (median 13, IQR 11-16) and lower in the hippocampus (7.5, 5.2-9.5), whereas counts in limbic-predominant cases were lower in cortical areas (4.3, 3.0-5.7) and higher in the hippocampus (27, 22-35). Hippocampal sparing cases had less hippocampal atrophy than did typical and limbic-predominant cases. Patients with hippocampal sparing AD were younger at death (mean 72 years [SD 10]) and a higher proportion of them were men (61 [63%]), whereas those with limbic-predominant AD were older (mean 86 years [SD 6]) and a higher proportion of them were women (87 [69%]). Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1H1 genotype was more common in limbic-predominant AD (54 [70%]) than in hippocampal sparing AD (24 [46%]; p=0.011), but did not differ significantly between limbic-predominant and typical AD (204 [59%]; p=0.11). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele status differed between AD subtypes only when data were stratified by age at onset. Clinical presentation, age at onset, disease duration, and rate of cognitive decline differed between the AD subtypes. These findings were confirmed in a validation cohort of 113 patients with AD. INTERPRETATION These data support the hypothesis that AD has distinct clinicopathological subtypes. Hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant AD subtypes might account for about 25% of cases, and hence should be considered when designing clinical, genetic, biomarker, and treatment studies in patients with AD.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates in neurons, while in corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), tau also aggregates in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We previously demonstrated that human CBD and PSP tauopathy lysates (CBD-tau and PSP-tau) contain distinct tau strains that propagate neuronal and glial tau aggregates in nontransgenic (nonTg) mouse brain. Yet the mechanism of glial tau transmission is unknown. Here, we developed a novel mouse model to knock down tau in neurons to test for glial tau transmission. While oligodendroglial tau pathology propagated across the mouse brain in the absence of neuronal tau pathology, astrocytic tau pathology did not. Oligodendroglial tau aggregates propagated along white matter tracts independently of neuronal axons, and resulted in oligodendrocyte cell loss. Thus, glial tau pathology has significant functional consequences independent of neuronal tau pathology.},

abstract = {Pathological tau aggregates occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative tauopathies. It is not clearly understood why tauopathies vary greatly in the neuroanatomical and histopathological patterns of tau aggregation, which contribute to clinical heterogeneity in these disorders. Recent studies have shown that tau aggregates may form distinct structural conformations, known as tau strains. Here, we developed a novel model to test the hypothesis that cell-to-cell transmission of different tau strains occurs in nontransgenic (non-Tg) mice, and to investigate whether there are strain-specific differences in the pattern of tau transmission. By injecting pathological tau extracted from postmortem brains of AD (AD-tau), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP-tau), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD-tau) patients into different brain regions of female non-Tg mice, we demonstrated the induction and propagation of endogenous mouse tau aggregates. Specifically, we identified differences in tau strain potency between AD-tau, CBD-tau, and PSP-tau in non-Tg mice. Moreover, differences in cell-type specificity of tau aggregate transmission were observed between tau strains such that only PSP-tau and CBD-tau strains induce astroglial and oligodendroglial tau inclusions, recapitulating the diversity of neuropathology in human tauopathies. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the neuronal connectome, but not the tau strain, determines which brain regions develop tau pathology. Finally, CBD-tau- and PSP-tau-injected mice showed spatiotemporal transmission of glial tau pathology, suggesting glial tau transmission contributes to the progression of tauopathies. Together, our data suggest that different tau strains determine seeding potency and cell-type specificity of tau aggregation that underlie the diversity of human tauopathies.},

The accumulation of the abnormal protein is responsible for a group of progressive and fatal disorders characterized by vacuolation, gliosis, and spongiform degeneration. Prion disorders are characterized by a triple aetiology: familial, sporadic or acquired, although most cases are sporadic. The mechanisms underlying prion neurotoxicity remain controversial, while novel findings lead to hypothesize intriguing pathways responsible for prion spreading. The present review aims to examine the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and hypothesizes the potential mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell transmission of the prion protein. In particular, a special emphasis is posed on the mechanisms of prion transmission within the gut and towards the central nervous system. The glycation of prion protein to form advanced glycation end-products (AGE) interacting with specific receptors placed on neighboring cells (RAGE) represents the key hypothesis to be discussed.},

The electroencephalogram is normal and structural and functional imaging reflect fronto-temporal lobar atrophy. In a minority of cases the amyotrophic form of motor neurone disease coexists with fronto-temporal dementia and has a rapid and brief duration of illness. Phenotypic characterization of patients at each level of description: clinical, anatomical, and histological, provides a foundation for the molecular genetic studies which ought to shed light on the etiology of this form of focal cerebral degeneration.},

abstract = {Previous animal research suggests that the spread of pathological agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD) follows the direction of signaling pathways. Specifically, tau pathology has been suggested to propagate in an infection-like mode along axons, from transentorhinal cortices to medial temporal lobe cortices and consequently to other cortical regions, while amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) pathology seems to spread in an activity-dependent manner among and from isocortical regions into limbic and then subcortical regions. These directed connectivity-based spread models, however, have not been tested directly in AD patients due to the lack of an in vivo method to identify directed connectivity in humans. Recently, a new method-metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM)-has been developed and validated in healthy participants that uses simultaneous FDG-PET and resting-state fMRI data acquisition to identify directed intrinsic effective connectivity (EC). To this end, postsynaptic energy consumption (FDG-PET) is used to identify regions with afferent input from other functionally connected brain regions (resting-state fMRI). Here, we discuss how this multi-modal imaging approach allows quantitative, whole-brain mapping of signaling direction in AD patients, thereby pointing out some of the advantages it offers compared to other EC methods (i.e., Granger causality, dynamic causal modeling, Bayesian networks). Most importantly, MCM provides the basis on which models of pathology spread, derived from animal studies, can be tested in AD patients. In particular, future work should investigate whether tau and A$\beta$ in humans propagate along the trajectories of directed connectivity in order to advance our understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms causing disease progression.},

abstract = {Clinicopathologic correlation studies are critically important for the field of Alzheimer disease (AD) research. Studies on human subjects with autopsy confirmation entail numerous potential biases that affect both their general applicability and the validity of the correlations. Many sources of data variability can weaken the apparent correlation between cognitive status and AD neuropathologic changes. Indeed, most persons in advanced old age have significant non-AD brain lesions that may alter cognition independently of AD. Worldwide research efforts have evaluated thousands of human subjects to assess the causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly, and these studies have been interpreted in different ways. We review the literature focusing on the correlation of AD neuropathologic changes (i.e. $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) with cognitive impairment. We discuss the various patterns of brain changes that have been observed in elderly individuals to provide a perspective for understanding AD clinicopathologic correlation and conclude that evidence from many independent research centers strongly supports the existence of a specific disease, as defined by the presence of A$\beta$ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although A$\beta$ plaques may play a key role in AD pathogenesis, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates best with the burden of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles.},

abstract = {TDP-43 was recently identified as the major disease protein in neuronal inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). TDP-43 is not only linked to disease mechanisms in FTLD-U, but it is also the most robust marker for the specific detection of neuronal inclusions in FTLD-U. In this study, we describe additional TDP-43 pathology in the white matter as a characteristic feature in a series of 38 FTLD-U cases including 3 cases with mutations in the progranulin gene. White matter pathology was most abundant in frontal and temporal lobes, but it was also detectable in brainstem and spinal cord. Based on morphology and double-labeling experiments, white matter cells with TDP-43-positive inclusions most likely represent oligodendrocytes. Biochemically, hyperphosphorylated and truncated TDP-43 was detectable in insoluble brain extracts from affected white matter regions in FTLD-U, similar to the biochemical signature observed in FTLD-U gray matter. Taken together, these results expand the spectrum of TDP-43 pathology in FTLD-U, suggesting that white matter pathology might contribute to the neurodegenerative process and clinical symptoms in FTLD-U.},

abstract = {Background: The release of a broad, longitudinal anatomical dataset by the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative promoted a surge of machine-learning studies aimed at predicting disease onset and progression. However, the excessive number of features used in these models often conceals their relationship to the Parkinsonian symptomatology. Objectives: The aim of this study is two-fold: (i) to predict future motor and cognitive impairments up to four years from brain features acquired at baseline; and (ii) to interpret the role of pivotal brain regions responsible for different symptoms from a neurological viewpoint. Methods: We test several deep-learning neural network configurations, and report our best results obtained with an autoencoder deep-learning model, run on a 5-fold cross-validation set. Comparison with Existing Methods: Our approach improves upon results from standard regression and others. It also includes neuroimaging biomarkers as features. Results: The relative contributions of pivotal brain regions to each impairment change over time, suggesting a dynamical reordering of culprits as the disease progresses. Specifically, the Putamen is initially the most critical region accounting for the overall cognitive state, only being surpassed by the Substantia Nigra in later years. The Pallidum is the first region to influence motor scores, followed by the parahippocampal and ambient gyri, and the anterior orbital gyrus. Conclusions: While the causal link between regional brain atrophy and Parkinson symptomatology is poorly understood, our methods demonstrate that the contributions of pivotal regions to cognitive and motor impairments are more dynamical than generally appreciated.},

abstract = {Amyloidopathies cause neurodegeneration in a substantial portion of the elderly population. Improvements in long term health care have made elderly individuals a large and growing demographic group, marking these diseases as a major public health concern. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most studied form of neurodegenerative amyloidopathy. Although our understanding of AD is far from complete, several decades of research have advanced our knowledge to the point where it is conceivable that some form of disease modifying therapy may be available in the near future. These advances have been built on a strong mechanistic understanding of the disease from its underlying genetics, molecular biology and clinical pathology. Insights derived from the study of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as some forms of frontotemporal dementia, have been critical to this process. This knowledge has allowed researchers to construct animal models of the disease process that have paved the way towards the development of therapeutics. However, what was once thought to be a straightforward problem has evolved into a series of disappointing outcomes. Examination of pathways common to all neurodegenerative diseases, including the cellular mechanisms that clear misfolded proteins and their regulation, may be the best way to move forward.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be a useful index of microstructural changes implicated in diffuse axonal injury (DAI) linked to persistent postconcussive symptoms, especially in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), for which conventional MR imaging techniques may lack sensitivity. We hypothesized that for mild TBI, DTI measures of DAI would correlate with impairments in reaction time, whereas the number of focal lesions on conventional 3T MR imaging would not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients with mild TBI with persistent symptoms were assessed for DAI by quantifying traumatic microhemorrhages detected on a conventional set of T2*-weighted gradient-echo images and by DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) within a set of a priori regions of interest. FA values 2.5 SDs below the region average, based on a group of 26 healthy control adults, were coded as exhibiting DAI. RESULTS: DTI measures revealed several predominant regions of damage including the anterior corona radiata (41% of the patients), uncinate fasciculus (29%), genu of the corpus callosum (21%), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (21%), and cingulum bundle (18%). The number of damaged white matter structures as quantified by DTI was significantly correlated with mean reaction time on a simple cognitive task (r = 0.49, P = .012). In contradistinction, the number of traumatic microhemorrhages was uncorrelated with reaction time (r = -0.08, P = .71). CONCLUSION: Microstructural white matter lesions detected by DTI correlate with persistent cognitive deficits in mild TBI, even in populations in which conventional measures do not. DTI measures may thus contribute additional diagnostic information related to DAI.},

abstract = {Memory and attentional control impairments are the two most common forms of dysfunction following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and lead to significant morbidity in patients, yet these functions are thought to be supported by different brain networks. This 3 T magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study investigates whether microstructural integrity of white matter, as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) within a small set of individually localized regions of interest (ROIs), is associated with these cognitive domains in normal adults and adults with mild TBI. Results in a sample of 23 normal controls reveal a significant correlation between attentional control and FA within a ROI in the left hemisphere anterior corona radiata. Furthermore, the controls demonstrate a correlation between memory performance and FA in a ROI placed in the uncinate fasciculus. Next, to examine whether these relationships are found in the pathological ranges of attention, memory and microstructural white matter integrity associated with mild TBI, these analyses were applied to a group of 43 mild TBI patients. Results, which generally demonstrated a wider range of attention, memory and FA scores, replicated the correlation between attentional control and FA in left hemisphere anterior corona radiata, as well as the correlation between memory performance and FA in the uncinate fasciculus. These two sets of brain-behaviour relationships were highly specific, as shown by a lack of correlation between attention and uncinate fasciculus FA and the lack of correlation between memory performance and anterior corona radiata FA. Furthermore, a 'correlational double dissociation' was demonstrated to exist between two distinct frontal structures independently associated with attention and memory, respectively, via a series of multiple regression analyses in both normal controls and adults with mild TBI. The results of the multiple regression analyses provide direct evidence that tract-specific variation in microstructural white matter integrity among normal controls and among mild TBI patients can account for much of the variation in performance in specific cognitive domains. More generally, such findings suggest that diffusion anisotropy measurement can be used as a quantitative biomarker for neurocognitive function and dysfunction.},

abstract = {Proteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) is regulated by cell-surface receptors. To determine whether neurotransmitter release in response to neuronal activation regulates APP processing in brain, we electrically depolarized superfused rat hippocampal slices and measured soluble APP derivatives released into the superfusate. Electrical depolarization caused a rapid increase in the release of both neurotransmitters and amino-terminal APP cleavage products. These derivatives lacked the APP carboxyl terminus and were similar to those found in both cell culture media and human cerebrospinal fluid. Superfusate proteins including lactate dehydrogenase were not changed by electrical depolarization. The release of amino-terminal APP derivatives increased with increasing stimulation frequencies from 0 to 30 Hz. The increased release was inhibited by the sodium-channel antagonist tetrodotoxin, suggesting that action-potential formation mediates the release of large amino-terminal APP derivatives. These results suggest that neuronal activity regulates APP processing in the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {Fibrillar deposits of highly phosphorylated tau are a key pathological feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and some frontotemporal dementias. Increasing evidence suggests that the presence of these end-stage neurofibrillary lesions do not cause neuronal loss, but rather that alterations to soluble tau proteins induce neurodegeneration. In particular, aberrant tau phosphorylation is acknowledged to be a key disease process, influencing tau structure, distribution, and function in neurons. Although typically described as a cytosolic protein that associates with microtubules and regulates axonal transport, several additional functions of tau have recently been demonstrated, including roles in DNA stabilization, and synaptic function. Most recently, studies examining the trans-synaptic spread of tau pathology in disease models have suggested a potential role for extracellular tau in cell signaling pathways intrinsic to neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence showing that tau phosphorylation plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. We also comment on the tractability of altering phosphorylation-dependent tau functions for therapeutic intervention in AD and related disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Because the signs associated with dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) can be heterogeneous, the goal of this study was to use 3-dimensional MRI to examine the various patterns of cortical atrophy that can be associated with dementia of AD type, and to investigate whether AD dementia can be categorized into anatomical subtypes. METHODS High-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRIs were taken of 152 patients in their earlier stages of AD dementia. The images were processed to measure cortical thickness, and hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was performed using Ward's clustering linkage. The identified clusters of patients were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group using a general linear model. RESULTS There were several distinct patterns of cortical atrophy and the number of patterns varied according to the level of cluster analyses. At the 3-cluster level, patients were divided into (1) bilateral medial temporal-dominant atrophy subtype (n = 52, ∼ 34.2%), (2) parietal-dominant subtype (n = 28, ∼ 18.4%) in which the bilateral parietal lobes, the precuneus, along with bilateral dorsolateral frontal lobes, were atrophic, and (3) diffuse atrophy subtype (n = 72, ∼ 47.4%) in which nearly all association cortices revealed atrophy. These 3 subtypes also differed in their demographic and clinical features. CONCLUSIONS This cluster analysis of cortical thickness of the entire brain showed that AD dementia in the earlier stages can be categorized into various anatomical subtypes, with distinct clinical features.},

abstract = {Extracellular plaques of amyloid-$\beta$ and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles made from tau are the histopathological signatures of Alzheimer's disease. Plaques comprise amyloid-$\beta$ fibrils that assemble from monomeric and oligomeric intermediates, and are prognostic indicators of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the importance of plaques to Alzheimer's disease, oligomers are considered to be the principal toxic forms of amyloid-$\beta$. Interestingly, many adverse responses to amyloid-$\beta$, such as cytotoxicity, microtubule loss, impaired memory and learning, and neuritic degeneration, are greatly amplified by tau expression. Amino-terminally truncated, pyroglutamylated (pE) forms of amyloid-$\beta$ are strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease, are more toxic than amyloid-$\beta$, residues 1-42 (A$\beta$(1-42)) and A$\beta$(1-40), and have been proposed as initiators of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Here we report a mechanism by which pE-A$\beta$ may trigger Alzheimer's disease. A$\beta$(3(pE)-42) co-oligomerizes with excess A$\beta$(1-42) to form metastable low-n oligomers (LNOs) that are structurally distinct and far more cytotoxic to cultured neurons than comparable LNOs made from A$\beta$(1-42) alone. Tau is required for cytotoxicity, and LNOs comprising 5% A$\beta$(3(pE)-42) plus 95% A$\beta$(1-42) (5% pE-A$\beta$) seed new cytotoxic LNOs through multiple serial dilutions into A$\beta$(1-42) monomers in the absence of additional A$\beta$(3(pE)-42). LNOs isolated from human Alzheimer's disease brain contained A$\beta$(3(pE)-42), and enhanced A$\beta$(3(pE)-42) formation in mice triggered neuron loss and gliosis at 3 months, but not in a tau-null background. We conclude that A$\beta$(3(pE)-42) confers tau-dependent neuronal death and causes template-induced misfolding of A$\beta$(1-42) into structurally distinct LNOs that propagate by a prion-like mechanism. Our results raise the possibility that A$\beta$(3(pE)-42) acts similarly at a primary step in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by the accumulation of the $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) within the brain along with hyperphosphorylated and cleaved forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Genetic, biochemical, and behavioral research suggest that physiologic generation of the neurotoxic A$\beta$ peptide from sequential amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is the crucial step in the development of AD. APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at high levels in the brain and metabolized in a rapid and highly complex fashion by a series of sequential proteases, including the intramembranous $\gamma$-secretase complex, which also process other key regulatory molecules. Why A$\beta$ accumulates in the brains of elderly individuals is unclear but could relate to changes in APP metabolism or A$\beta$ elimination. Lessons learned from biochemical and genetic studies of APP processing will be crucial to the development of therapeutic targets to treat AD.},

abstract = {Alpha-synuclein accumulated in the brain of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is phosphorylated at serine129 (palpha-synuclein). We investigated the accumulation of palpha-synuclein in the brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We employed 18 DLB patients with neocortical Lewy body type pathology (nLBTP) with or without AD. We also employed the same number of AD cases without significant nLBTP. We refer to the former group as the nLBTP group and to the latter as the AD type pathology (ADTP) group. In the nLBTP group, palpha-synuclein positive neurite pathology such as threads and dots occurs in all layers of the temporal neocortex. It was comparable in degree with tau pathology in AD. Fifteen cases in the nLBTP group were associated with Abeta deposition that meets the CERAD plaque score "C" and one case with a score "B". In these plaque-associated cases, the severity of palpha-synuclein pathology was related to the degree of Abeta deposition. In the cases with relatively moderate Abeta deposition, tau pathology was disproportionately mild in the nLBTP group, while the total of tau and palpha-synuclein pathology was proportionate to Abeta deposition in both the nLBTP and ADTP groups. Our results support the ideas that there is an overlap in the pathology between AD and DLB and that Abeta promotes accumulation of both alpha-synuclein and tau. The procession from Abeta to neurite pathology in the cerebral cortex of AD and DLB may be unifiable.},

abstract = {Amyloid-beta (Abeta) containing plaques and tau-laden neurofibrillary tangles are the defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better mimic this neuropathology, we generated a novel triple transgenic model of AD (3xTg-AD) harboring three mutant genes: beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPPSwe), presenilin-1 (PS1M146V), and tauP301L. The 3xTg-AD mice progressively develop Abeta and tau pathology, with a temporal- and regional-specific profile that closely mimics their development in the human AD brain. We find that Abeta deposits initiate in the cortex and progress to the hippocampus with aging, whereas tau pathology is first apparent in the hippocampus and then progresses to the cortex. Despite equivalent overexpression of the human betaAPP and human tau transgenes, Abeta deposition develops prior to the tangle pathology, consistent with the amyloid cascade hypothesis. As these 3xTg-AD mice phenocopy critical aspects of AD neuropathology, this model will be useful in pre-clinical intervention trials, particularly because the efficacy of anti-AD compounds in mitigating the neurodegenerative effects mediated by both signature lesions can be evaluated.},

Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque and tangle pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal Abeta with regards to synaptic plasticity. The recapitulation of salient features of AD in these mice clarifies the relationships between Abeta, synaptic dysfunction, and tangles and provides a valuable model for evaluating potential AD therapeutics as the impact on both lesions can be assessed.},

abstract = {? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.Comprehensive knowledge of the brain's wiring diagram is fundamental for understanding how the nervous system processes information at both local and global scales. However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

abstract = {Expression profiling of restricted neural populations using microarrays can facilitate neuronal classification and provide insight into the molecular bases of cellular phenotypes. Due to the formidable heterogeneity of intermixed cell types that make up the brain, isolating cell types prior to microarray processing poses steep technical challenges that have been met in various ways. These methodological differences have the potential to distort cell-type-specific gene expression profiles insofar as they may insufficiently filter out contaminating mRNAs or induce aberrant cellular responses not normally present in vivo. Thus we have compared the repeatability, susceptibility to contamination from off-target cell-types, and evidence for stress-responsive gene expression of five different purification methods - Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), Immunopanning (PAN), Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), and manual sorting of fluorescently labeled cells (Manual). We found that all methods obtained comparably high levels of repeatability, however, data from LCM and TRAP showed significantly higher levels of contamination than the other methods. While PAN samples showed higher activation of apoptosis-related, stress-related and immediate early genes, samples from FACS and Manual studies, which also require dissociated cells, did not. Given that TRAP targets actively translated mRNAs, whereas other methods target all transcribed mRNAs, observed differences may also reflect translational regulation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Okaty et al.},

abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects as many as 1-2% of persons aged 60 years and older. With the aging of the population, the frequency of PD is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Current therapy is largely based on a dopamine replacement strategy, primarily using the dopamine precursor levodopa. However, chronic treatment is associated with the development of motor complications, and the disease is inexorably progressive. Further, advancing disease is associated with the emergence of features such as freezing, falling, and dementia which are not adequately controlled with dopaminergic therapies. Indeed, it is now appreciated that these nondopaminergic features are common and the major source of disability for patients with advanced disease. Many different therapeutic agents and treatment strategies have been evaluated over the past several years to try and address these unmet medical needs, and many promising approaches are currently being tested in the laboratory and in the clinic. As a result, there are now many new therapies and strategic approaches available for the treatment of the different stages of PD, with which the treating physician must be familiar in order to provide patients with optimal care. This monograph provides an overview of the management of PD patients, with an emphasis on pathophysiology, and the results of recent clinical trials. It is intended to provide physicians with an understanding of the different treatment options that are available for managing the different stages of the disease and the scientific rationale of the different approaches.},

The objective of this study is to characterise the imaging signatures of the main FTD phenotypes along the ALS-FTD spectrum. A total of 100 participants underwent comprehensive multimodal neuroimaging, genetic testing and neuropsychological evaluation. Seven patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), 11 patients with non-fluent-variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), two patients with sematic-variant primary progressive aphasia(svPPA), 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and FTD carrying the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat (C9 + ALS-FTD), 10 patients with ALS-FTD without hexanucleotide repeats (C9-ALS-FTD), 20 ALS patients without behavioural or cognitive deficits (ALSnci) and 40 healthy controls (HC) were included in a prospective quantitative neuroimaging study. Phenotype-specific spatial patterns of pathology were identified along the ALS-FTD spectrum, highlighting a strikingly focal distribution of disease burden as opposed to global atrophy. Significant motor cortex and corticospinal tract degeneration was identified in both bvFTD and nfvPPA patients. C9-ALS-FTD patients exhibited widespread extramotor pathology and significant precentral gyrus atrophy compared to ALSnci patients. ROI analyses confirmed focal grey matter alterations in Broca's and Wernicke's area in language variant FTD cohorts. Our findings confirm that the clinical manifestations of FTD are underpinned by phenotype-specific patterns of white and grey matter degeneration.},

We propose that the molecular classification of brain regions on the basis of their gene expression profile can circumvent subjective neuroanatomical definitions and produce common reference frameworks that can incorporate cell types, connectivity, activity, and other modalities. Here we review the technological and conceptual advances made possible by spatial transcriptomics in the context of advancing neuroanatomy and discuss how molecular neuroanatomy can redefine mapping of the nervous system.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Amyloid-$\beta$ positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows in vivo detection of fibrillar plaques, a core neuropathological feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Its diagnostic utility is still unclear because amyloid plaques also occur in patients with non-AD dementia. OBJECTIVE: To use individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity on PET in a wide variety of dementia syndromes. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched from January 2004 to April 2015 for amyloid PET studies. STUDY SELECTION: Case reports and studies on neurological or psychiatric diseases other than dementia were excluded. Corresponding authors of eligible cohorts were invited to provide individual participant data. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were provided for 1359 participants with clinically diagnosed AD and 538 participants with non-AD dementia. The reference groups were 1849 healthy control participants (based on amyloid PET) and an independent sample of 1369 AD participants (based on autopsy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated prevalence of positive amyloid PET scans according to diagnosis, age, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 status, using the generalized estimating equations method. RESULTS: The likelihood of amyloid positivity was associated with age and APOE $\epsilon$4 status. In AD dementia, the prevalence of amyloid positivity decreased from age 50 to 90 years in APOE $\epsilon$4 noncarriers (86% [95% CI, 73%-94%] at 50 years to 68% [95% CI, 57%-77%] at 90 years; n = 377) and to a lesser degree in APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers (97% [95% CI, 92%-99%] at 50 years to 90% [95% CI, 83%-94%] at 90 years; n = 593; P < .01). Similar associations of age and APOE $\epsilon$4 with amyloid positivity were observed in participants with AD dementia at autopsy. In most non-AD dementias, amyloid positivity increased with both age (from 60 to 80 years) and APOE $\epsilon$4 carriership (dementia with Lewy bodies: carriers [n = 16], 63% [95% CI, 48%-80%] at 60 years to 83% [95% CI, 67%-92%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 18], 29% [95% CI, 15%-50%] at 60 years to 54% [95% CI, 30%-77%] at 80 years; frontotemporal dementia: carriers [n = 48], 19% [95% CI, 12%-28%] at 60 years to 43% [95% CI, 35%-50%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 160], 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%] at 60 years to 14% [95% CI, 11%-18%] at 80 years; vascular dementia: carriers [n = 30], 25% [95% CI, 9%-52%] at 60 years to 64% [95% CI, 49%-77%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 77], 7% [95% CI, 3%-18%] at 60 years to 29% [95% CI, 17%-43%] at 80 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among participants with dementia, the prevalence of amyloid positivity was associated with clinical diagnosis, age, and APOE genotype. These findings indicate the potential clinical utility of amyloid imaging for differential diagnosis in early-onset dementia and to support the clinical diagnosis of participants with AD dementia and noncarrier APOE $\epsilon$4 status who are older than 70 years.},

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that tau pathology is closely linked to symptomatology and patterns of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease, in contrast to the more diffuse distribution of amyloid-$\beta$ pathology. We included 20 patients meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, presenting with a variety of clinical phenotypes, and 15 amyloid-$\beta$-negative cognitively normal individuals, who underwent (18)F-AV1451 (tau), (11)C-PiB (amyloid-$\beta$) and (18)F-FDG (glucose metabolism) positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Voxel-wise contrasts against controls (at P < 0.05 family-wise error corrected) showed that (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG patterns in patients with posterior cortical atrophy ('visual variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 7) specifically targeted the clinically affected posterior brain regions, while (11)C-PiB bound diffusely throughout the neocortex. Patients with an amnestic-predominant presentation (n = 5) showed highest (18)F-AV1451 retention in medial temporal and lateral temporoparietal regions. Patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia ('language variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 5) demonstrated asymmetric left greater than right hemisphere (18)F-AV1451 uptake in three of five patients. Across 30 FreeSurfer-defined regions of interest in 16 Alzheimer's disease patients with all three positron emission tomography scans available, there was a strong negative association between (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG uptake (Pearson's r = -0.49 ± 0.07, P < 0.001) and less pronounced positive associations between (11)C-PiB and (18)F-FDG (Pearson's r = 0.16 ± 0.09, P < 0.001) and (18)F-AV1451 and (11)C-PiB (Pearson's r = 0.18 ± 0.09, P < 0.001). Voxel-wise linear regressions thresholded at P < 0.05 (uncorrected) showed that, across all patients, younger age was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in wide regions of the neocortex, while older age was associated with increased (18)F-AV1451 in the medial temporal lobe. APOE ϵ4 carriers showed greater temporal and parietal (18)F-AV1451 uptake than non-carriers. Finally, worse performance on domain-specific neuropsychological tests was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in key regions implicated in memory (medial temporal lobes), visuospatial function (occipital, right temporoparietal cortex) and language (left > right temporoparietal cortex). In conclusion, tau imaging-contrary to amyloid-$\beta$ imaging-shows a strong regional association with clinical and anatomical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. Although preliminary, these results are consistent with and expand upon findings from post-mortem, animal and cerebrospinal fluid studies, and suggest that the pathological aggregation of tau is closely linked to patterns of neurodegeneration and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.},

To identify the correlative pattern of brain changes for differentiating parkinsonian syndromes, we applied discriminant analysis techniques by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). T1-weighted volume data and diffusion tensor images were obtained by MRI in eighteen patients with MSA-C, 12 patients with MSA-P, 21 patients with Parkinson's disease, and 21 healthy controls. They were evaluated using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics, respectively. Discriminant functions derived by step wise methods resulted in correct classification rates of 0.89. When differentiating these diseases with the use of three independent variables together, the correct classification rate was the same as that obtained with step wise methods. These findings support the view that each parkinsonian syndrome has structural deviations in multiple brain areas and that a combination of structural brain measures can help to distinguish parkinsonian syndromes.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To estimate the prevalence of dementia and its subtypes in the general population and examine the relation of the disease to education. Design: Population based cross sectional study. Setting: Ommoord, a suburb of Rotterdam. Subjects: 7528 participants of the Rotterdam study aged 55-106 years. Results: 474 cases of dementia were detected, giving an overall prevalence of 6.3%. Prevalence ranged from 0.4% (5/1181 subjects) at age 55-59 years to 43.2% (19/44) at 95 years and over. Alzheimer's disease was the main subdiagnosis (339 cases; 72%); it was also the main cause of the pronounced increase in dementia with age. The relative proportion of vascular dementia (76 cases; 16%), Parkinson's disease dementia (30; 6%), and other dementias (24; 5%) decreased with age. A substantially higher prevalence of dementia was found in subjects with a low level of education. The association with education was not due to confounding by cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The prevalence of dementia increases exponentially with age. About one third of the population aged 85 and over has dementia. Three quarters of all dementia is due to Alzheimer's disease. In this study an inverse dose-response relation was found between education and dementia--in particular, Alzheimer's disease. Key messages Key messages Of all cases of dementia, 72% were cases of Alzheimer's disease The pronounced increase in prevalence of dementia with age was due to a substantial increase in Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease was more often diagnosed in less educated people The association between dementia and education could not be explained by cardiovascular disease comorbidity},

abstract = {Neuroinflammatory glial response may contribute to degenerative processes in Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate changes in microglial activity associated with changes in the presynaptic dopamine transporter density in the PD brain in vivo, we studied 10 early-stage drug-naive PD patients twice using positron emission tomography with a radiotracer for activated microglia [(11)C](R)-PK11195 and a dopamine transporter marker [(11)C]CFT. Quantitative levels of binding potentials (BPs) of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 and [(11)C]CFT in the nigrostriatal pathway were estimated by compartment analyses. The levels of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP in the midbrain contralateral to the clinically affected side were significantly higher in PD than that in 10 age-matched healthy subjects. The midbrain [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP levels significantly correlated inversely with [(11)C]CFT BP in the putamen and correlated positively with the motor severity assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in PD. In healthy subjects, the [(11)C](R)-PK11195 BP in the thalamus and midbrain showed an age-dependent increase. In vivo demonstration of parallel changes in microglial activation and corresponding dopaminergic terminal loss in the affected nigrostriatal pathway in early PD supports that neuroinflammatory responses by intrinsic microglia contribute significantly to the progressive degeneration process of the disease and suggests the importance of early therapeutic intervention with neuroprotective drugs.},

abstract = {Human clinical trials seek to ameliorate the disease states and symptomatic progression of illnesses that, as of yet, are largely untreatable according to clinical standards. Ideally, clinical trials test “disease-modifying drugs,” i.e., therapeutic agents that specifically modify pathological features or molecular bases of the disease and would presumably have a large impact on disease progression. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, this approach appears to have stalled progress in the successful development of clinically useful therapies. For the last 25 years, clinical trials involving AD have centered on beta-amyloid (A $\beta$ ) and the A $\beta$ hypothesis of AD progression and pathology. According to this hypothesis, the progression of AD begins following an accumulation of A $\beta$ peptide, leading to eventual synapse loss and neuronal cell death: the true overriding pathological feature of AD. Clinical trials arising from the A $\beta$ hypothesis target causal steps in the pathway in order to reduce the formation of A $\beta$ or enhance clearance, and though agents have been successful in this aim, they remain unsuccessful in rescuing cognitive function or slowing cognitive decline. As such, further use of resources in the development of treatment options for AD that target A $\beta$ , its precursors, or its products should be reevaluated. The purpose of this review was to give an overview of how human clinical trials are conducted in the USA and to assess the results of recent failed trials involving AD, the majority of which were based on the A $\beta$ hypothesis. Based on these current findings, it is suggested that lowering A $\beta$ is an unproven strategy, and it may be time to refocus on other targets for the treatment of this disease including pathological forms of tau.},

abstract = {Model-based investigations of trans-neuronal spreading mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases relate the pattern of pathology severity to the brain's connectivity matrix, which reveals information about how pathology propagates through the connectivity network. Such network models typically use networks based on functional or structural connectivity in young and healthy individuals, and only end-stage patterns of pathology, thereby ignoring/excluding the effects of normal ageing and disease progression. Here we examine the sequence of changes in the elderly brain's anatomical connectivity over the course of a neurodegenerative disease. We do this in a data-driven manner that is not dependent upon clinical disease stage, by using event-based disease progression modelling. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, we sequence the progressive decline of anatomical connectivity, as quantified by graph-theory metrics, in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Ours is the first single model to contribute to understanding all three of the nature, the location, and the sequence of changes to anatomical connectivity in the human brain due to Alzheimer's disease. Our experimental results reveal new insights into Alzheimer's disease: that degeneration of anatomical connectivity in the brain may be a viable, even early, biomarker and should be considered when studying such neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has recently witnessed a great deal of activity focused on developing new statistical learning tools for automated inference using imaging data. The workhorse for many of these techniques is the support vector machine (SVM) framework (or more generally kernel-based methods). Most of these require, as a first step, specification of a kernel matrix K between input examples (i.e., images). The inner product between images I(i) and I(j) in a feature space can generally be written in closed form and so it is convenient to treat K as "given." However, in certain neuroimaging applications such an assumption becomes problematic. As an example, it is rather challenging to provide a scalar measure of similarity between two instances of highly attributed data such as cortical thickness measures on cortical surfaces. Note that cortical thickness is known to be discriminative for neurological disorders, so leveraging such information in an inference framework, especially within a multi-modal method, is potentially advantageous. But despite being clinically meaningful, relatively few works have successfully exploited this measure for classification or regression. Motivated by these applications, our paper presents novel techniques to compute similarity matrices for such topologically-based attributed data. Our ideas leverage recent developments to characterize signals (e.g., cortical thickness) motivated by the persistence of their topological features, leading to a scheme for simple constructions of kernel matrices. As a proof of principle, on a dataset of 356 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, we report good performance on several statistical inference tasks without any feature selection, dimensionality reduction, or parameter tuning.},

abstract = {Importance: There are limitations in current diagnostic testing approaches for Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To examine plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (P-tau217) as a diagnostic biomarker for AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Three cross-sectional cohorts: an Arizona-based neuropathology cohort (cohort 1), including 34 participants with AD and 47 without AD (dates of enrollment, May 2007-January 2019); the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort (cohort 2), including cognitively unimpaired participants (n = 301) and clinically diagnosed patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 178), AD dementia (n = 121), and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 99) (April 2017-September 2019); and a Colombian autosomal-dominant AD kindred (cohort 3), including 365 PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and 257 mutation noncarriers (December 2013-February 2017). Exposures: Plasma P-tau217. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the discriminative accuracy of plasma P-tau217 for AD (clinical or neuropathological diagnosis). Secondary outcome was the association with tau pathology (determined using neuropathology or positron emission tomography [PET]). Results: Mean age was 83.5 (SD, 8.5) years in cohort 1, 69.1 (SD, 10.3) years in cohort 2, and 35.8 (SD, 10.7) years in cohort 3; 38% were women in cohort 1, 51% in cohort 2, and 57% in cohort 3. In cohort 1, antemortem plasma P-tau217 differentiated neuropathologically defined AD from non-AD (area under the curve [AUC], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.97]) with significantly higher accuracy than plasma P-tau181 and neurofilament light chain (NfL) (AUC range, 0.50-0.72; P <.05). The discriminative accuracy of plasma P-tau217 in cohort 2 for clinical AD dementia vs other neurodegenerative diseases (AUC, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]) was significantly higher than plasma P-tau181, plasma NfL, and MRI measures (AUC range, 0.50-0.81; P <.001) but not significantly different compared with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) P-tau217, CSF P-tau181, and tau-PET (AUC range, 0.90-0.99; P >.15). In cohort 3, plasma P-tau217 levels were significantly greater among PSEN1 mutation carriers, compared with noncarriers, from approximately 25 years and older, which is 20 years prior to estimated onset of MCI among mutation carriers. Plasma P-tau217 levels correlated with tau tangles in participants with (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.64; P <.001), but not without (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.15; P =.33), $\beta$-amyloid plaques in cohort 1. In cohort 2, plasma P-tau217 discriminated abnormal vs normal tau-PET scans (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.96]) with significantly higher accuracy than plasma P-tau181, plasma NfL, CSF P-tau181, CSF A$\beta$42:A$\beta$40 ratio, and MRI measures (AUC range, 0.67-0.90; P <.05), but its performance was not significantly different compared with CSF P-tau217 (AUC, 0.96; P =.22). Conclusions and Relevance: Among 1402 participants from 3 selected cohorts, plasma P-tau217 discriminated AD from other neurodegenerative diseases, with significantly higher accuracy than established plasma-and MRI-based biomarkers, and its performance was not significantly different from key CSF-or PET-based measures. Further research is needed to optimize the assay, validate the findings in unselected and diverse populations, and determine its potential role in clinical care.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Diverse lines of evidence suggest that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have a causal role in its pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we discuss recent evidence that Abeta may be part of a mechanism controlling synaptic activity, acting as a positive regulator presynaptically and a negative regulator postsynaptically. The pathological accumulation of oligomeric Abeta assemblies depresses excitatory transmission at the synaptic level, but also triggers aberrant patterns of neuronal circuit activity and epileptiform discharges at the network level. Abeta-induced dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons likely increases synchrony among excitatory principal cells and contributes to the destabilization of neuronal networks. Strategies that block these Abeta effects may prevent cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Potential obstacles and next steps toward this goal are discussed.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that a “prion-like” mechanism underlies the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). We extend and tailor previously developed quantitative and predictive network diffusion model (NDM) to PD, by specifically modeling the trans-neuronal spread of alpha-synuclein outward from the substantia nigra (SN). The model demonstrated the spatial and temporal patterns of PD from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies and was statistically validated using MRI deformation of 232 Parkinson's patients. After repeated seeding simulations, the SN was found to be the most likely seed region, supporting its unique lynchpin role in Parkinson's pathology spread. Other alternative spread models were also evaluated for comparison, specifically, random spread and distance-based spread; the latter tests for Braak's original caudorostral transmission theory. We showed that the distance-based spread model is not as well supported as the connectivity-based model. Intriguingly, the temporal sequencing of affected regions predicted by the model was in close agreement with Braak stages III-VI, providing what we consider a “computational Braak” staging system. Finally, we investigated whether the regional expression patterns of implicated genes contribute to regional atrophy. Despite robust evidence for genetic factors in PD pathogenesis, NDM outperformed regional genetic expression predictors, suggesting that network processes are far stronger mediators of regional vulnerability than innate or cell-autonomous factors. This is the first finding yet of the ramification of prion-like pathology propagation in Parkinson's, as gleaned from in vivo human imaging data. The NDM is potentially a promising robust and clinically useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis and staging of PD.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia in adults, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder exhibiting well-defined neuropathological hallmarks. It is known that disease pathology involves misfolded amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and tau proteins, and exhibits a relatively stereotyped progression over decades. The relationship between AD neuropathological hallmarks (A$\beta$, hypometabolism, and tau proteins) and imaging biomarkers (MRI, AV-45/FDG-PET) is not fully understood. In addition, biomarker pathologies are oftentimes discordant, wherein it may show varying levels of abnormality across brain regions. Evidence based on recent elucidation of trans-neuronal "prion-like" transmission and other available data already suggests that disease spread follows the brain's fiber connectivity network. Thereby, the brain's connectome information can be used to predict the process of disease spread in AD. A recently established mathematical model of AD pathology spread using a connectome-based network diffusion model was successful in encapsulating neurodegenerative progression. Motivated by these network-based findings, the current study explores whether and how network connectivity mediates the interactions between various AD biomarkers. We hypothesized that the structural connectivity matrix will mediate the cross-sectional association between regional AD-associated hypometabolism and A$\beta$ deposition. Given recent reports of inherent or lifetime activity of brain regions as strong predictors of A$\beta$ deposition in patients, we also tested whether healthy metabolism exerts a network-mediated effect on A$\beta$ deposition and hypometabolism in AD patients. We found that regional A$\beta$ deposition is best predicted by a linear combination of both regional healthy local metabolism and connectome-mediated regional healthy metabolism.},

abstract = {The neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, with pathological involvement of cerebral motor and, additionally, extra-motor areas, in a clinicopathological spectrum with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A key unresolved question is whether the distribution of pathology in ALS is driven by molecular factors such as regional gene expression, by differential network vulnerability, or is a combination of both. A system of histopathological staging of ALS based on the regional burden of TDP-43 pathology observed in post mortem brains has been supported to some extent by analysis of distribution of in vivo structural MRI changes. In this paper, computational modelling using a Network Diffusion Model (NDM) was used to investigate whether a process of focal pathological ‘seeding' followed by structural network-based spread recapitulated post mortem histopathological staging and, secondly, whether this had any relationship to the pattern of expression of a panel of genes implicated in ALS across the healthy brain. Regionally parcellated T1-weighted MRI data from ALS patients (baseline n=79) was studied in relation to a healthy control structural connectome and a database of associated regional cerebral gene expression. The NDM provided strong support for a structural network-based basis for regional pathological spread in ALS, but no simple relationship to the spatial distribution of ALS-related genes in the healthy brain. Intriguingly, the critical seed regions for spread within the model were not within the primary motor cortex but basal ganglia, thalamus and insula, where NDM recapitulated aspects of the post mortem histopathological staging system. Within the ALS-FTD clinicopathological spectrum, non-primary motor structures may be among the earliest sites of cerebral pathology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease report aggregation and transmission of pathogenic proteins between cells. The topography of these diseases in the human brain also, therefore, displays a well-characterized and stereotyped regional pattern, and a stereotyped progression over time. This is most commonly true for AD and other dementias characterized by hallmark misfolded tau or alpha-synuclein pathology. Both tau and synuclein appear to propagate within brain circuits using a shared mechanism. The most canonical synucleopathy is PD; however, much less studied is a rare disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The hallmark pathology and atrophy in PSP are, therefore, also highly stereotyped: initially appearing in the striatum, followed by its neighbors and connected cortical areas. In this study, we explore two mechanistic aspects hitherto unknown about the canonical network diffusion model (NDM) of spread: (a) whether the NDM can apply to other common degenerative pathologies, specifically PSP, and (b) whether the directionality of spread is important in explaining empirical data. Our results on PSP reveal two important findings: first, that PSP is amenable to the connectome-based ND modeling in the same way as previously applied to AD and FTD and, second, that the NDM fit with empirical data are significantly enhanced by using the directional rather than the non-directional form of the human connectome. Specifically, we show that both the anterograde model of transmission (some to axonal terminal) and retrograde mode explain PSP topography more accurately than non-directional transmission. Collectively, these data show that the intrinsic architecture of the structural network mediates disease spread in PSP, most likely via a process of trans-neuronal transmission. These intriguing results have several ramifications for future studies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is one of the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, affects millions of people worldwide. Due to its polygenic nature, AD is believed to be caused not by defects in single genes, but by variations in a large number of genes and their complex interactions, which ultimately contribute to the broad spectrum of disease phenotypes. Extraction of insights and knowledge from microarray and network data will lead to a better understanding of complex diseases. The present study aimed to identify genes with differential topology and their further association with other biological processes that regulate causative factors for AD, ageing (AG) and other diseases. Our analysis revealed a common sharing of important biological processes and putative candidate genes among AD and AG. Some significant novel genes and other variants for various biological processes have been reported as being associated with AD, AG, and other diseases, and these could be implicated in biochemical events leading to AD from AG through pathways, interactions, and associations. Novel information for network motifs such as BiFan, MIM (multiple input module), and SIM (single input module) and their close variants has also been discovered and this implicit information will help to improve research into AD and AG. Ten major classes for TFs (transcription factors) have been identified in our data, where hundreds of TFBS patterns are being found associated with AD, and other disease. Structural and physico-chemical properties analysis for these TFBS classes revealed association of biological processes involved with other severe human disease. Nucleosomes and linkers positional information could provide insights into key cellular processes. Unique miRNA (micro RNA) targets were identified as another regulatory process for AD. The association of novel genes and variants of existing genes have also been explored for their interaction and association with other diseases that are either directly or indirectly implicated through AG and AD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fractional anisotropy values of several white matter tracts with the aim of differentiating a healthy population from persons with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with memory impairment and 16 volunteer controls participated in the study. MRI was performed with a 1.5-T system. Conventional MR images and diffusion tensor images were obtained for all participants. The diffusion tensor imaging data were postprocessed, and low b-value, fractional anisotropy, and fractional anisotropy color-coded maps were calculated. With the three maps as an anatomic reference, fractional anisotropy was measured for hippocampal formations, superior longitudinal fascicles, posterior cingulate gyri, and the splenium of the corpus callosum. Kruskal-Wallis and Steel-type multiple-comparison nonparametric tests were performed for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy values for the splenium of the corpus callosum, bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, and bilateral superior longitudinal fascicles of patients with mild cognitive impairment and those with probable Alzheimer's disease were significantly lower than the values of controls. No differences were found in hippocampal formations in any group. No significant difference was found in fractional anisotropy values in comparisons of mild cognitive impairment versus possible Alzheimer's disease and probable Alzheimer's disease or comparisons of probable Alzheimer's disease and possible Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging is a promising technique for the evaluation of patients with probable mild cognitive impairment. Early detection of the disease expands the treatment options, increasing the likelihood of a good clinical response and enhancing the quality of life of patients and their relatives. Further studies with larger populations are needed to confirm the role of diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of memory impairment.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogenous and can be classified into several subtypes. Here, we propose a robust subtyping method for AD based on cortical atrophy patterns and graph theory. We calculated similarities between subjects in their atrophy patterns throughout the whole brain, and clustered subjects with similar atrophy patterns using the Louvain method for modular organization extraction. We applied our method to AD patients recruited at Samsung Medical Center and externally validated our method by using the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method categorized very mild AD into three clinically distinct subtypes with high reproducibility (>90%); the parietal-predominant (P), medial temporal-predominant (MT), and diffuse (D) atrophy subtype. The P subtype showed the worst clinical presentation throughout the cognitive domains, while the MT and D subtypes exhibited relatively mild presentation. The MT subtype revealed more impaired language and executive function compared to the D subtype.},

abstract = {Imaging agents capable of quantifying the brain's tau aggregates will allow a more precise staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to examine the in vitro properties as well as the in vivo kinetics, using gold standard methods, of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) tau imaging agent [18F]MK-6240. In vitro properties of [18F]MK-6240 were estimated with autoradiography in postmortem brain tissues of 14 subjects (seven AD patients and seven age-matched controls). In vivo quantification of [18F]MK-6240 binding was performed in 16 subjects (four AD patients, three mild cognitive impairment patients, six healthy elderly individuals, and three healthy young individuals) who underwent 180-min dynamic scans; six subjects had arterial sampling for metabolite correction. Simplified approaches for [18F]MK-6240 quantification were validated using full kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input function. All participants also underwent amyloid-PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro [18F]MK-6240 uptake was higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls in brain regions expected to contain tangles such as the hippocampus, whereas no difference was found in the cerebellar gray matter. In vivo, [18F]MK-6240 displayed favorable kinetics with rapid brain delivery and washout. The cerebellar gray matter had low binding across individuals, showing potential for use as a reference region. A reversible two-tissue compartment model well described the time–activity curves across individuals and brain regions. Distribution volume ratios using the plasma input and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) calculated after the binding approached equilibrium (90 min) were correlated and higher in mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia patients than in controls. Reliability analysis revealed robust SUVRs calculated from 90 to 110 min, while earlier time points provided inaccurate estimates. This evaluation shows an [18F]MK-6240 distribution in concordance with postmortem studies and that simplified quantitative approaches such as the SUVR offer valid estimates of neurofibrillary tangle load 90 min post injection. [18F]MK-6240 is a promising tau tracer with the potential to be applied in the disease diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic interventions.},

We have created Lis1 heterozygous mutant mice by gene targeting. Heterozygous mutant mice are viable and fertile, but display global organizational brain defects as a result of impaired neuronal migration. To assess the functional impact of the mutation, Lis1 heterozygous mice and their wild-type littermates were evaluated on a wide variety of behavioral tests. Lis1 mutant mice displayed abnormal hindpaw clutching responses and were impaired on a rotarod test. Lis1 heterozygous mice were also impaired in the spatial learning version of the Morris water task. Impaired motor behavior and spatial learning and memory in Lis1 mutant mice indicates that impaired neuronal migration can have functional effects on complex behavioral responses. The behavioral findings also support the use of the Lis1 mutant mice as a model from human type 1 lissencephaly.},

abstract = {An important component of the latency period of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) can be attributed to delays during the propagation of the infectious prion isoform, PrPSc, through peripheral nervous tissues. A growing body of data report that the host prion protein, PrPC, is required in both peripheral and central nervous tissues for susceptibility to infection. We introduce a mathematical model, which treats the PrPSc as a mobile infectious pathogen, and show how peripheral delays can be understood in terms of the intercellular dispersal properties of the PrPSc strain, its decay rate, and its efficiency at transforming the PrPC. It has been observed that when two pathogenic strains co-infect a host, the presence of the first inoculated strain can slow down, or stop completely, the spread of the second strain. This is thought to result from a reduced concentration of host protein available for conversion by the second strain. Our model can explain the mechanisms of such interstrain competition and the time-course of the increased delay. The model provides a link between those data suggesting a role for a continuous chain of PrP-expressing tissue linking peripheral sites to the brain, and data on prion strain competition.},

abstract = {The distribution of serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors in the rat brain was studied by light microscopic quantitative autoradiography. Receptors were labeled with four ligands: [3H]ketanserin, [3H]mesulergine, [3H]LSD and [3H]spiperone, which are reported to show high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors. Co-incubation with increasing concentrations of several well-known 5-HT2-selective drugs, such as pirenperone, cinanserin and ketanserin, resulted in an inhibition of the binding of the four 3H-labeled ligands to the same areas. However, all of them recognized, in addition to 5-HT2 sites, other populations of binding sites. Receptor densities were quantified by microdensitometry with the aid of a computer-assisted image-analysis system. Our results reveal a heterogenous distribution of 5-HT2 receptor densities in the rat brain. Very high concentrations were localized in the claustrum, olfactory tubercle and layer IV of the neocortex. The anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex and layer I of neocortex were also rich in 5-HT2 receptors. Intermediate concentrations of receptors were found in caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, layer V of neocortex, ventral dentate gyrus and mammillary bodies. Areas containing only low concentrations of receptors included the thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, medulla, cerebellum and spinal cord. The specificity of the different ligands used is discussed in terms of the other populations of sites recognized by them. The distribution of 5-HT2 receptors here reported is discussed in correlation with (a) the known distribution of serotoninergic terminals, (b) the specific anatomical systems and (c) the central effects reported to be mediated by 5-HT2-selective drugs. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {The numbers and distribution of the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques have been determined in several areas of the neocortex in brains affected by various degrees of severity of Alzheimer disease. The homotypical cortex of the "association" areas of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes are severely involved, whereas the motor, somatic sensory, and primary visual areas are virtually unaffected. The neurofibrillary tangles are mainly in the supra- and infragranular layers, particularly in layers III and V. In all areas except area 18 in the occipital lobe, there are approximately twice as many tangles in layer V as in layer III. The tangles are arranged in definite clusters, and those in the supra- and infragranular layers are in register. The neuritic plaques occur in all layers but predominantly affect layers II and III and do not show clustering. These data on the severity of the pathological involvement in different areas of the neocortex and the laminar distribution and the clustering of the tangles support the suggestion that the pathological changes in Alzheimer disease affect regions that are interconnected by well-defined groups of connections and that the disease process may extend along the connecting fibers. The invariable and severe involvement of the olfactory areas of the brain in this disease is in striking contrast to the minimal changes in the somatic sensory and primary visual areas and raises the possibility that the olfactory pathway may be initially involved.},

We found mHTT spreading in three different neural network models: human neurons integrated in the neural network of organotypic brain slices of HD mouse model, an ex vivo corticostriatal slice model and the corticostriatal pathway in vivo. Transneuronal propagation of mHTT was blocked by two different botulinum neurotoxins, each known for specifically inactivating a single critical component of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. Moreover, healthy human neurons in HD mouse model brain slices displayed non-cell autonomous changes in morphological integrity that were more pronounced when these neurons bore mHTT aggregates. Altogether, our findings suggest that transneuronal propagation of mHTT might be an important and underestimated contributor to the pathophysiology of HD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

We performed a serial diffusion-weighted imaging study in a population of multiple system atrophy patients and analyzed the evolution of diffusion properties in striatal and extrastriatal brain regions. Diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained in 11 multiple system atrophy patients at baseline and after a follow-up of 11.7 ± 1.2 months, and Trace (D) changes in different brain regions were correlated with disease duration and severity. A significant increase in Trace (D) was observed at follow-up in the putamen (P < .001), pons (P = .003), cerebellar white matter (P = .03), thalamus (P = .013), and frontal white matter (P = .021). Both Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale Part II and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores significantly increased at follow-up (P = .003), but percent changes of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III and Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale Part II did not correlate with percent changes of Trace (D) values in any brain region. This longitudinal study provides new insights into the progression of neurodegeneration in different brain regions in multiple system atrophy. Our results confirm that abnormal diffusivity in the putamen is sensitive to change over time in multiple system atrophy patients and show for the first time a progression of Trace (D) alterations in specific extrastriatal regions. Diffusivity changes in these regions may be useful for monitoring disease progression even after a short follow-up period. {\textcopyright} 2011 Movement Disorder Society.},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e. g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Microglia are the cells that comprise the innate immune system in the brain. First described more than a century ago, these cells were initially assigned a secondary role in the central nervous system (CNS) with respect to the protagonists, neurons. However, the latest advances have revealed the complexity and importance of microglia in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia associated with aging. This pathology is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$), which forms senile plaques in the neocortex, as well as by the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, a process that leads to the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Over the past few years, efforts have been focused on studying the interaction between A$\beta$ and microglia, together with the ability of the latter to decrease the levels of this peptide. Given that most clinical trials following this strategy have failed, current endeavors focus on deciphering the molecular mechanisms that trigger the tau-induced inflammatory response of microglia. In this review, we summarize the most recent studies on the physiological and pathological functions of tau protein and microglia. In addition, we analyze the impact of microglial AD-risk genes (APOE, TREM2, and CD33) in tau pathology, and we discuss the role of extracellular soluble tau in neuroinflammation.},

Indeed, a single outlier can result in a highly inaccurate summary of the data. Yet, it remains the most commonly used measure of association in psychology research. Here we describe a free Matlab((R)) based toolbox (http://sourceforge.net/projects/robustcorrtool/) that computes robust measures of association between two or more random variables: the percentage-bend correlation and skipped-correlations. After illustrating how to use the toolbox, we show that robust methods, where outliers are down weighted or removed and accounted for in significance testing, provide better estimates of the true association with accurate false positive control and without loss of power. The different correlation methods were tested with normal data and normal data contaminated with marginal or bivariate outliers. We report estimates of effect size, false positive rate and power, and advise on which technique to use depending on the data at hand.},

abstract = {It is well known that within long–standing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions there is axonal loss but whether it is an early or late event has been more difficult to establish. The use of immunocytochemical methods that reveal axonal end–bulbs is a valuable approach to investigating acute axonal injury in human pathological material. The application of these techniques to multiple sclerosis tissue reveals evidence of axonal injury in acute lesions; the distribution of the end–bulbs in acute and active–chronic lesions is associated with regions of maximal density of infiltrating macrophages. Axon injury within the MS lesion will result in both Wallerian degeneration of the axon and also retrograde degeneration of the cell body. The functional consequences of the axon injury will depend upon numbers of axons injured and the topographical organization of the fibres coursing through the lesion. The molecular mechanisms by which the recruited leucocytes damage or transect the axons are not known. However, investigations in the Wld mutant mouse with very slow Wallerian degeneration demonstrate that axon degeneration is not simply a passive disintegration of the axon but has clear parallels with the active processes of programmed cell death. The presence of early axon injury and the consequences of an ever increasing load of neuronal damage has important implications not only for when therapy should be initiated in MS but also the therapeutic target.},

Despite normal cognitive performance, they may be at higher risk of cognitive decline compared with individuals without SMI. METHODS We used a discriminative function (a support vector machine) trained on an independent data set of 226 healthy control subjects and 191 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia to characterize the baseline gray matter patterns of 24 individuals with SMI and 53 control subjects. We tested for associations of these gray matter patterns with SMI presence, cognitive performance at baseline, and cognitive decline at follow-up. RESULTS Individuals with SMI showed greater similarity to an AD gray matter pattern compared with control subjects without SMI. In addition, episodic memory decline was associated with an AD gray matter pattern in the SMI group. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate a link between the gray matter atrophy pattern of patients with AD and the presence of SMI. Furthermore, multivariate pattern recognition approaches seem to be a sensitive method for identifying subtle brain changes that correspond to future memory decline in SMI.},

abstract = {As radiologists, our role in the workup of the dementia patient has long been limited by the sensitivity of our imaging tools and lack of effective treatment options. Over the past 30 years, we have made tremendous strides in understanding the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of Alzheimer disease (AD). We now know that the pathologic features of AD are present 1 to 2 decades prior to development of symptoms, though currently approved symptomatic therapies are administered much later in the disease course. The search for true disease-modifying therapy continues and many clinical trials are underway. Current outcome measures, based on cognitive tests, are relatively insensitive to pathologic disease progression, requiring long, expensive trials with large numbers of participants. Biomarkers, including neuroimaging, have great potential to increase the power of trials by matching imaging methodology with therapeutic mechanism. One of the most important advances over the past decade has been the development of in vivo imaging probes targeted to amyloid beta protein, and one agent is already available for clinical use. Additional advances include automated volumetric imaging methods to quantitate cerebral volume loss. Use of such techniques in small, early phase trials are expected to significantly increase the number and quality of candidate drugs for testing in larger trials. In addition to a critical role in trials, structural, molecular, and functional imaging techniques can give us a window on the etiology of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This combination of developments has potential to bring diagnostic radiology to the forefront in AD research, therapeutic trials, and patient care.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess intrinsic properties of water diffusion in normal human brain by using quantitative parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which are insensitive to patient orientation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Maps of the principal diffusivities of D, of Trace(D), and of diffusion anisotropy indices were calculated in eight healthy adults from 31 multisection, interleaved echo-planar diffusion-weighted images acquired in about 25 minutes. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in Trace(D) (approximately 2,100 x 10(-6) mm2/sec) were found within normal brain parenchyma, except in the cortex, where Trace(D) was higher. Diffusion anisotropy varied widely among different white matter regions, reflecting differences in fiber-tract architecture. In the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular diffusivities was approximately threefold higher than previously reported, and diffusion appeared cylindrically symmetric. However, in other white matter regions, particularly in the centrum semiovale, diffusion anisotropy was low, and cylindrical symmetry was not observed. Maps of parameters derived from D were also used to segment tissues based on their diffusion properties. CONCLUSION: A quantitative characterization of water diffusion in anisotropic, heterogeneously oriented tissues is clinically feasible. This should improve the neuroradiologic assessment of a variety of gray and white matter disorders.},

abstract = {Indices of diffusion anisotropy calculated from diffusion coefficients acquired in two or three perpendicular directions are rotationally variant. In living monkey brain, these indices severely underestimate the degree of diffusion anisotropy. New indices calculated from the entire diffusion tensor are rotationally invariant (RI). They show that anisotropy is highly variable in different white matter regions depending on the degree of coherence of fiber tract directions. In structures with a regular, parallel fiber arrangement, water diffusivity in the direction parallel to the fibers (D| &ap; 1400-1800 × 10-6 mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the average diffusivity in directions perpendicular to them ((D + D&bottom;prime)/2 &ap; 150-300 × 10-6 mm2/s), and is almost three times higher than previously reported. In structures where the fiber pattern is less coherent (e.g., where fiber bundles merge), diffusion anisotropy is significantly reduced. However, RI anisotropy indices are still susceptible to noise contamination. Monte Carlo simulations show that these indices are statistically biased, particularly those requiring sorting of the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor based on their magnitude. A new intervoxel anisotropy index is proposed that locally averages inner products between diffusion tensors in neighboring voxels. This ldquolatticerdquo RI index has an acceptably low error variance and is less susceptible to bias than any other RI anisotropy index proposed to date.},

Connectivity is a distinctive feature of the brain and the integrity of functional network dynamics is crucial for normal functioning. A better understanding of network disruption in the neurodegenerative dementias might help bridge the gap between molecular changes, pathological changes, and symptoms. Recent findings on functional network disruption as assessed with resting-state or intrinsic connectivity functional MRI and electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have shown distinct patterns of network disruption across the major neurodegenerative diseases. These network abnormalities are somewhat specific to the clinical syndromes and, in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, network disruption tracks the pattern of pathological changes. These findings might have practical implications for diagnostic accuracy, allowing earlier detection of neurodegenerative diseases even at the presymptomatic stage, and tracking of disease progression.},

Deficiencies in fast axonal transport (FAT) were suggested to play a crucial role in neuronal dysfunction and loss for a diverse set of dying back neuropathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular basis for pathological changes in FAT were undetermined. Recent findings indicate that soluble intracellular oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) species may play a critical role in AD pathology. Real-time analysis of vesicle mobility in isolated axoplasms perfused with oAbeta showed bidirectional axonal transport inhibition as a consequence of endogenous casein kinase 2 (CK2) activation. Conversely, neither unaggregated amyloid beta nor fibrillar amyloid beta affected FAT. Inhibition of FAT by oAbeta was prevented by two specific pharmacological inhibitors of CK2, as well as by competition with a CK2 substrate peptide. Furthermore, perfusion of axoplasms with active CK2 mimics the inhibitory effects of oAbeta on FAT. Both oAbeta and CK2 treatment of axoplasm led to increased phosphorylation of kinesin-1 light chains and subsequent release of kinesin from its cargoes. Therefore pharmacological modulation of CK2 activity may represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention in AD.},

Because of this close link, gradual accumulation of A $\beta$ into amyloid plaques has been reported in brain areas with intense neuronal activity, including cortical regions that display elevated activation at resting state. However, the link between A $\beta$ and activity is not always linear and recent studies report exceptions to the view of “more activity, more plaques.” Here, we review the literature about the activity-dependent production of A $\beta$ in both human cases and AD models and focus on the evidences that brain regions with elevated convergence of synaptic connections (herein referred to as brain nodes) are particularly vulnerable to A $\beta$ accumulation. Next, we will examine data supporting the hypothesis that, since A $\beta$ is released from synaptic terminals, $\beta$ -amyloidosis can spread in AD brain by advancing through synaptically connected regions, which makes brain nodes vulnerable to A $\beta$ accumulation. Finally, we consider possible mechanisms that account for $\beta$ -amyloidosis progression through synaptically linked regions.},

Here we performed cellular-resolution microendoscopic Ca2+ imaging from genetically defined cell types in the dorsomedial PFC of mice performing a PFC-dependent sensory discrimination task. We found that inhibitory interneurons of the same subtype were similar to each other, but different subtypes preferentially signaled different task-related events: somatostatin-positive neurons primarily signaled motor action (licking), vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive neurons responded strongly to action outcomes, whereas parvalbumin-positive neurons were less selective, responding to sensory cues, motor action, and trial outcomes. Compared to each interneuron subtype, pyramidal neurons showed much greater functional heterogeneity, and their responses varied across cortical layers. Such cell-type and laminar differences in neuronal functional properties may be crucial for local computation within the PFC microcircuit. Cellular-resolution Ca2+ imaging from the mouse PFC during goal-directed behavior reveals sensory, motor, and outcome signals. Interneurons of the same subtype are functionally similar, but different subtypes encode different task-related signals. Excitatory neurons have diverse properties that vary across layers.},

abstract = {AIM: To estimate the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias in the USA using a nationally representative sample. METHODS: The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study sample was composed of 856 individuals aged 71 years and older from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who were evaluated for dementia using a comprehensive in-home assessment. An expert consensus panel used this information to assign a diagnosis of normal cognition, cognitive impairment but not demented, or dementia (and dementia subtype). Using sampling weights derived from the HRS, we estimated the national prevalence of dementia, AD and vascular dementia by age and gender. RESULTS: The prevalence of dementia among individuals aged 71 and older was 13.9%, comprising about 3.4 million individuals in the USA in 2002. The corresponding values for AD were 9.7% and 2.4 million individuals. Dementia prevalence increased with age, from 5.0% of those aged 71-79 years to 37.4% of those aged 90 and older. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia prevalence estimates from this first nationally representative population-based study of dementia in the USA to include subjects from all regions of the country can provide essential information for effective planning for the impending healthcare needs of the large and increasing number of individuals at risk for dementia as our population ages.},

abstract = {There are still insufficient data on the natural course of Parkinson's disease (PD) owing to lack of standardized longitudinal follow-up studies. Reported progression rates in early PD vary considerably by a factor of 2 to 3. Similarly, data from sequential 18Fdopa PET studies in PD patients have produced variable decline rates of PET indices ranging between 7 and 70% per decade. Risk factors for rapid progression include old age at onset, concomitant major depression, dementia, and akinetic-rigid symptom presentation. The introduction of levodopa into the routine treatment of PD patients had a dramatic impact on symptomatic control without affecting the underlying rate of disease progression. By contrast, monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibition by deprenyl monotherapy in early PD was shown to delay the need for levodopa by around 9 months. However, the neuroprotective action disappeared after 2 years of follow-up. Furthermore, deprenyl also failed to influence the subsequent development of levodopa-induced motor complications. Available studies on mortality in PD provide heterogeneous mortality rates, probably because of discrepancies between patient populations with respect to co-morbidity, disease stage at study entry, and diagnostic accuracy. However, the most recent follow-up from the DATATOP cohort suggests normal life expectancy in carefully selected patients without significant co-morbidity and with adequate treatment and expert follow-up.},

The nosological distinction of the conditions has remained controversial because of broad clinical and pathological overlap. Treatment issues in both clinical settings are virtually identical. Treatment of Parkinsonism is often complicated by drug-induced psychosis and reduced levodopa responsiveness. Cognition, alertness, attention, as well as apathy or aggressive behavior have been shown to respond to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in randomized controlled trials both in DLB and PDD. Such treatment may also improve hallucinosis, but many patients will require add-on treatment with atypical neuroleptics to control drug-induced psychotic reactions. Clozapine and quetiapine are the drugs most commonly used and, contrary to classic neuroleptics, risperidone or olanzapine do not seem to cause severe side effects according to published data.},

We recently studied the formation of NFTs in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and their subsequent propagation through neural circuits in the rTgTauEC mouse model (de Calignon et al., 2012). We now examine the consequences of suppressing transgene expression with doxycycline on the NFT-associated pathological features of neuronal system deafferentation, NFT progression and propagation, and neuronal loss. At 21 months of age we observe that EC axonal lesions are associated with an abnormal sprouting response of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive fibers, a phenotype reminiscent of human AD. At 24 months, NFTs progress, tau inclusions propagate to the dentate gyrus, and neuronal loss is evident. Suppression of the transgene expression from 18 to 24 months led to reversal of AChE sprouting, resolution of Gallyas-positive and Alz50-positive NFTs, and abrogation of progressive neuronal loss. These data suggest that propagation of NFTs, as well as some of the neural system consequences of NFTs, can be reversed in an animal model of NFT-associated toxicity, providing proof in principle that these lesions can be halted, even in established disease.},

abstract = {Early observations of the patterns of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease suggested a hierarchical vulnerability of neurons for tangles, and a widespread nonspecific pattern of plaques that nonetheless seemed to correlate with the terminal zone of tangle bearing neurons in some instances. The first neurofibrillary cortical lesions in Alzheimer's disease occur in the entorhinal cortex, thereby disrupting the origin of the perforant pathway projection to the hippocampus, and amyloid deposits are often found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, which is the terminal zone of the entorhinal cortex. We have modeled these anatomical changes in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses both P301L tau (uniquely in the medial entorhinal cortex), and mutant APP/PS1 (in a widespread distribution), to examine the anatomical consequences of early tangles, plaques, or the combination. We find that tau uniformly occupies the terminal zone of the perforant pathway in tau expressing mice. By contrast, the addition of amyloid deposits in this area leads to disruption of the perforant pathway terminal zone and apparent aberrant distribution of tau containing axons. Moreover, human P301L tau containing axons appear to increase the extent of dystrophic axons around plaques. Thus the presence of amyloid deposits in the axonal terminal zone of pathological tau containing neurons profoundly impacts their normal connectivity. J. Comp.

abstract = {The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is essential for synaptic function, plasticity and neuronal survival. At the axon terminal, when BDNF binds to its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body, via retrograde transport, regulating gene expression and neuronal function. Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early impairments in synaptic function that may result in part from neurotrophin signaling deficits. Growing evidence suggests that soluble $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) assemblies cause synaptic dysfunction by disrupting both neurotransmitter and neurotrophin signaling. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate a BDNF retrograde signaling deficit in AD transgenic mouse neurons (Tg2576) that can be reversed by $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors. Using BDNF-GFP, we show that BDNF-mediated TrkB retrograde trafficking is impaired in Tg2576 axons. Furthermore, A$\beta$ oligomers alone impair BDNF retrograde transport. Thus, A$\beta$ reduces BDNF signaling by impairing axonal transport and this may underlie the synaptic dysfunction observed in AD.},

abstract = {We previously found that BDNF-dependent retrograde trafficking is impaired in AD transgenic mouse neurons. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate that A$\beta$ oligomers compromise BDNF-mediated retrograde transport by impairing endosomal vesicle velocities, resulting in impaired downstream signaling driven by BDNF/TrkB, including ERK5 activation, and CREB-dependent gene regulation. Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. A$\beta$-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, A$\beta$ may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.},

Neuroimaging techniques that probe connectivity within these circuits can be used to understand how these disorders develop as well as identify potential targets for medical and surgical therapies. Indeed, network analysis of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has identified abnormal metabolic networks associated with the cardinal motor symptoms of PD, such as akinesia and tremor, as well as PD-related cognitive dysfunction. More recent task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reproduced several of the altered connectivity patterns identified in these abnormal PD-related networks. A similar network analysis approach in dystonia revealed abnormal disease related metabolic patterns in both manifesting and non-manifesting carriers of dystonia mutations. Other multimodal imaging approaches using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging in patients with primary genetic dystonia suggest abnormal connectivity within the CbTC circuits mediate the clinical manifestations of this inherited neurodevelopmental disorder.

abstract = {Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple neurological deficits that evolve over time. It is also associated with an increased incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, clinicians need better tools to predict a patient's long-term prognosis. Methods: Diffusion-weighted and anatomical MRI data were collected from 17 adolescents (mean age = 15y8mo) with moderate-to-severe TBI and 19 healthy controls. Using a network diffusion model (NDM), we examined the effect of progressive deafferentation and gray matter thinning in young TBI patients. Moreover, using a novel automated inference method, we identified several injury epicenters in order to determine the neural degenerative patterns in each TBI patient. Results: We were able to identify the subject-specific patterns of degeneration in each patient. In particular, the hippocampus, temporal cortices, and striatum were frequently found to be the epicenters of degeneration across the TBI patients. Orthogonal transformation of the predicted degeneration, using principal component analysis, identified distinct spatial components in the temporal–hippocampal network and the cortico-striatal network, confirming the vulnerability of these networks to injury. The NDM model, best predictive of the degeneration, was significantly correlated with time since injury, indicating that NDM can potentially capture the pathological progression in the chronic phase of TBI. Interpretation: These findings suggest that network spread may help explain patterns of distant gray matter thinning, which would be consistent with Wallerian degeneration of the white matter connections (i.e., “diaschisis”) from diffuse axonal injuries and multifocal contusive injuries, and the neurodegenerative patterns of abnormal protein aggregation and transmission, which are hallmarks of brain changes in TBI. NDM approaches could provide highly subject-specific biomarkers relevant for disease monitoring and personalized therapies in TBI.},

We investigated whether the network diffusion model, which models transneuronal spread as diffusion of pathological proteins via the brain connectome, can determine the severity of neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD) (N = 26) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 26) to measure neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. The network diffusion model was used to test whether disease spread, via the human brain connectome, is a viable mechanism to explain the distribution of pathology across the brain. We found that an eigenmode identified in the healthy human brain connectome Laplacian matrix, accurately predicts the cortico-striatal spatial pattern of degeneration in HD. Furthermore, the spread of neural degeneration from sub-cortical brain regions, including the accumbens and thalamus, generates a spatial pattern which represents the typical neurodegenerative characteristics in HD. The white matter connections connecting the nodes with the highest amount of disease factors, when diffusion based disease spread is initiated from the striatum, were found to be most vulnerable to disconnection in HD. These findings suggest that trans-neuronal diffusion of mutant huntingtin protein across the human brain connectome may explain the pattern of gray matter degeneration and white matter disconnection that are hallmarks of HD.},

abstract = {Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) hypothesize stereotyped progression via white matter (WM) fiber connections, most likely via trans-synaptic transmission of toxic proteins along neuronal pathways. An important question in the field is whether and how organization of fiber pathways is affected by disease. It remains unknown whether fibers act as conduits of degenerative pathologies, or if they also degenerate with the gray matter network. This work uses graph theoretic modeling in a longitudinal design to investigate the impact of WM network organization on AD pathology spread. We hypothesize if altered WM network organization mediates disease progression, then a previously published network diffusion model will yield higher prediction accuracy using subject-specific connectomes in place of a healthy template connectome. Neuroimaging data in 124 subjects from ADNI were assessed. Graph topology metrics show preserved network organization in patients compared to controls. Using a published diffusion model, we further probe the effect of network alterations on degeneration spread in AD. We show that choice of connectome does not significantly impact the model's predictive ability. These results suggest that, despite measurable changes in integrity of specific fiber tracts, WM network organization in AD is preserved. Further, there is no difference in the mediation of putative pathology spread between healthy and AD-impaired networks. This conclusion is somewhat at variance with previous results, which report global topological disturbances in AD. Our data indicates the combined effect of edge thresholding, binarization, and inclusion of subcortical regions to network graphs may be responsible for previously reported effects.},

After briefly reviewing the progress that has been made in diagnostic assessments of patients with senile dementia and in investigations of the neuropathology of AD, we discuss some of the genes/proteins that are causative or risk factors for this disease, including those encoding amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 and 2, and apolipoprotein E. In addition, we comment on several potential new candidate loci/genes. Subsequently, we review selected recent reports of analyses of a variety of lines of Tg mice that show several neuropathological features of AD, including A$\beta$-amyloid deposits and dystrophic neurites. Finally, we discuss the several important issues in future investigations of Tg mice, with particular emphasis on the influences of genetic strains on phenotype, especially behavior, and strategies for making new models of neurodegenerative disorders. We believe that investigations of these Tg models will (a) enhance understanding of the relationships between impaired performance on memory tasks and the pathological/biochemical abnormalities in brain, (b) help to clarify pathogenic mechanisms in vivo, (c) lead to identification of new therapeutic targets, and (d) allow testing of new treatment strategies first in mice and then, if successful, in humans with AD.},

Alzheimer's disease combined with intracerebral vascular disease accounts for another 13 to 17% of cases. The principal risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is age. The incidence of the M disease doubles every 5 years after 65 years of age, with the diagnosis of 1275 new cases per year per 100,000 persons older than 65 years of age.1 Data on centenarians show that Alzheimer's disease is not necessarily the outcome of aging2; neverthe- less, the odds of receiving the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease after 85 years of age exceed one in three. As the aging population increases, the prevalence will approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases in the United States by mid-century.3 Many molecular lesions have been detected in Alzheimer's disease, but the over- arching theme to emerge from the data is that an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the aging brain results in oxidative and inflammatory damage, which in turn leads to energy failure and synaptic dysfunction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the rapidly expanding literature of amyloid PET imaging with particular attention to Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal volunteers. DESIGN: Literature searches were performed using Medline up to February 2010. Individual articles were then examined for additional references not revealed by automated searches. This yielded 79 articles whose abstracts were read by the authors to select key papers. RESULTS: Amyloid deposition assessed using PIB-PET is significantly elevated in AD and DLB compared to controls and those with FTD. In MCI, uptake is often intermediate between AD and normal ageing, and excessive amyloid burden in non-demented individuals with MCI are likely to represent high-risk cases. Amyloid deposition appears to be an early event, and as dementia progresses clinical decline seems to be more associated with neurodegeneration than amyloid burden. CONCLUSIONS: PIB-PET imaging is a sensitive and specific marker for underlying A$\beta$ amyloid deposition and represents an important investigative tool for examining the relationship between amyloid burden, clinical symptoms and structural and functional changes in dementia. Amyloid imaging may also be useful for selecting patients for anti-amyloid therapies. However, studies have identified PIB-positive cases in otherwise healthy older individuals (10-30%), limiting diagnostic specificity. Development of biomarkers for investigating other aspects of dementia pathology, i.e. soluble A$\beta$, tau, synuclein and brain inflammation would further inform our understanding and assist in studying disease-modifying and preventive treatments in dementia.},

abstract = {Importance It is critically important to improve our ability to diagnose and track Alzheimer disease (AD) as early as possible. Individuals with autosomal dominant forms of AD can provide clues as to which and when biological changes are reliably present prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Objective To characterize the associations between amyloid and tau deposits in the brains of cognitively unimpaired and impaired carriers of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional imaging study, we leveraged data from a homogeneous autosomal dominant AD kindred, which allowed us to examine measurable tau deposition as a function of individuals' proximity to the expected onset of dementia. Cross-sectional measures of carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) and flortaucipir F 18 (previously known as AV 1451, T807) PET imaging were assessed in 24 PSEN1 E280A kindred members (age range, 28-55 years), including 12 carriers, 9 of whom were cognitively unimpaired and 3 of whom had mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively unimpaired noncarriers. Main Outcomes and Measures We compared carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B PET cerebral with cerebellar distribution volume ratios as well as flortaucipir F 18 PET cerebral with cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios in mutation carriers and noncarriers. Spearman correlations characterized the associations between age and mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels or regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio levels in both groups. Results Of the 24 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 38.0 (7.4) years, or approximately 6 years younger than the expected onset of clinical symptoms in carriers. Compared with noncarriers, cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers had elevated mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels in their late 20s, and 7 of 9 carriers older than 30 years reached the threshold for amyloidosis (distribution volume ratio level > 1.2). Elevated levels of tau deposition were seen within medial temporal lobe regions in amyloid-positive mutation carriers 6 years before clinical onset of AD in this kindred. Substantial tau deposition in the neocortex was only observed in 1 unimpaired carrier and in those with mild cognitive impairment. $\beta$-Amyloid uptake levels were diffusely elevated in unimpaired carriers approximately 15 years prior to expected onset of mild cognitive impairment. In carriers, higher levels of tau deposition were associated with worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.60; P = .04; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.54; P = .06) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease Word List Delayed Recall (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.86; P < .001; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.70; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance The present findings add to the growing evidence that molecular markers can characterize biological changes associated with AD in individuals who are still cognitively unimpaired. The findings also suggest that tau PET imaging may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish individuals at high risk to develop the clinical symptoms of AD and to track disease progression.},

abstract = {Amyloid imaging represents a major advance in neuroscience, enabling the detection and quantification of pathologic protein aggregations in the brain. In this review we survey current amyloid imaging techniques, focusing on positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)carbon-labelled Pittsburgh Compound-B ((11)C-PIB), the most extensively studied and best validated tracer. PIB binds specifically to fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits, and is a sensitive marker for Abeta pathology in cognitively normal older individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). PIB-PET provides us with a powerful tool to examine in vivo the relationship between amyloid deposition, clinical symptoms, and structural and functional brain changes in the continuum between normal aging and AD. Amyloid imaging studies support a model in which amyloid deposition is an early event on the path to dementia, beginning insidiously in cognitively normal individuals, and accompanied by subtle cognitive decline and functional and structural brain changes suggestive of incipient AD. As patients progress to dementia, clinical decline and neurodegeneration accelerate and proceed independently of amyloid accumulation. In the future, amyloid imaging is likely to supplement clinical evaluation in selecting patients for anti-amyloid therapies, while MRI and FDG-PET may be more appropriate markers of clinical progression.},

abstract = {Patients with early age-of-onset Alzheimer's disease show more rapid progression, more generalized cognitive deficits and greater cortical atrophy and hypometabolism compared to late-onset patients at a similar disease stage. The biological mechanisms that underlie these differences are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine in vivo whether metabolic differences between early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease are associated with differences in the distribution and burden of fibrillar amyloid-beta. Patients meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's; Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) were divided based on estimated age at first symptom (less than or greater than 65 years) into early-onset (n = 21, mean age-at-onset 55.2 +/- 5.9 years) and late-onset (n = 18, 72.0 +/- 4.7 years) groups matched for disease duration and severity. Patients underwent positron emission tomography with the amyloid-beta-ligand [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B and the glucose analogue [(18)F]-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose. A group of cognitively normal controls (n = 30, mean age 73.7 +/- 6.4) was studied for comparison. [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B images were analysed using Logan graphical analysis (cerebellar reference) and [(18)F]-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose images were normalized to mean activity in the pons. Group differences in tracer uptake were assessed on a voxel-wise basis using statistical parametric mapping, and by comparing mean values in regions of interest. To account for brain atrophy, analyses were repeated after applying partial volume correction to positron emission tomography data. Compared to normal controls, both early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease patient groups showed increased [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B uptake throughout frontal, parietal and lateral temporal cortices and striatum on voxel-wise and region of interest comparisons (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in regional or global [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B binding between early-onset and late-onset patients. In contrast, early-onset patients showed significantly lower glucose metabolism than late-onset patients in precuneus/posterior cingulate, lateral temporo-parietal and occipital corticies (voxel-wise and region of interest comparisons, P < 0.05). Similar results were found for [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B and [(18)F]-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose using atrophy-corrected data. Age-at-onset correlated positively with glucose metabolism in precuneus, lateral parietal and occipital regions of interest (controlling for age, education and Mini Mental State Exam, P < 0.05), while no correlations were found between age-at-onset and [(11)C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B binding. In summary, a comparable burden of fibrillar amyloid-beta was associated with greater posterior cortical hypometabolism in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Our data are consistent with a model in which both early amyloid-beta accumulation and increased vulnerability to amyloid-beta pathology play critical roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in young patients.},

abstract = {Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is found at autopsy in up to one third of patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), but clinical features that predict AD pathology in PPA are not well defined. We studied the relationships between language presentation, A$\beta$ amyloidosis, and glucose metabolism in three PPA variants using [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B ([ 11C]PIB) and [18F]-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET). Methods: Patients meeting PPA criteria (N = 15) were classified as logopenic aphasia (LPA), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), or semantic dementia (SD) based on language testing. [11C]PIB distribution volume ratios were calculated using Logan graphical analysis (cerebellar reference). [18F]FDG images were normalized to pons. Partial volume correction was applied. Results: Elevated cortical PIB (by visual inspection) was more common in LPA (4/4 patients) than in PNFA (1/6) and SD (1/5) ( p < 0.02). In PIB-positive PPA, PIB uptake was diffuse and indistinguishable from the pattern in matched AD patients (n = 10). FDG patterns were focal and varied by PPA subtype, with left temporoparietal hypometabolism in LPA, left frontal hypometabolism in PNFA, and left anterior temporal hypometabolism in SD. FDG uptake was significant asymmetric (favoring left hypometabolism) in PPA ( p < 0.005) but not in AD. Interpretation: LPA is associated with A$\beta$ amyloidosis, suggesting that subclassification of PPA based on language features can help predict the likelihood of AD pathology. Language phenotype in PPA is closely related to metabolic changes that are focal and anatomically distinct between subtypes, but not to amyloid deposition patterns that are diffuse and similar to AD. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Neurological Association.

This can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, where the goal is to find a spatially smooth solution while permitting discontinuities. Although it is easy to apply MRFs to the MR reconstruction problem, the resulting energy minimization problem poses some interesting challenges. It lies outside of the class of energy functions that can be straightforwardlyminimized with graph cuts. We show how graph cuts can nonetheless be adapted to solve this problem, and provide some theoretical analysis of the properties of our algorithm. Experimentally, our method gives very strong performance, with a substantial improvement in SNR when compared with widely-used methods for MR reconstruction.},

abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) characterized by an epileptogenic focus in the medial temporal lobe is the most common form of focal epilepsy. However, the seizures are not confined to the temporal lobe but can spread to other, anatomically connected brain regions where they can cause similar structural abnormalities as observed in the focus. The aim of this study was to derive whole-brain networks from volumetric data and obtain network-centric measures, which can capture cortical thinning characteristic of TLE and can be used for classifying a given MRI into TLE or normal, and to obtain additional summary statistics that relate to the extent and spread of the disease. T1-weighted whole-brain images were acquired on a 4-T magnet in 13 patients with TLE with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis (TLE-MTS), 14 patients with TLE with normal MRI (TLE-no), and 30 controls. Mean cortical thickness and curvature measurements were obtained using the FreeSurfer software. These values were used to derive a graph, or network, for each subject. The nodes of the graph are brain regions, and edges represent disease progression paths. We show how to obtain summary statistics like mean, median, and variance defined for these networks and to perform exploratory analyses like correlation and classification. Our results indicate that the proposed network approach can improve accuracy of classifying subjects into two groups (control and TLE) from 78% for non-network classifiers to 93% using the proposed approach. We also obtain network "peakiness" values using statistical measures like entropy and complexity-this appears to be a good characterizer of the disease and may have utility in surgical planning.},

abstract = {The goal of deconvolution is to recover an image x from its convolution with a known blurring function. This is equivalent to inverting the linear system y = Hx. In this paper, we consider the generalized problem where the system matrix H is an arbitrary nonnegative matrix. Linear inverse problems can be solved by adding a regularization term to impose spatial smoothness. To avoid oversmoothing, the regularization term must preserve discontinuities; this results in a particularly challenging energy minimization problem. Where H is diagonal, as occurs in image denoising, the energy function can be solved by techniques such as graph cuts, which have proven to be very effective for problems in early vision. When H is nondiagonal, however, the data cost for a pixel to have a intensity depends on the hypothesized intensities of nearby pixels, so existing graph cut methods cannot be applied. This paper shows how to use graph cuts to obtain a discontinuity preserving solution to a linear inverse system with an arbitrary non-negative system matrix. We use a dynamically chosen approximation to the energy which can he minimized by graph cuts; minimizing this approximation also decreases the original energy. Experimental results are shown for MRI reconstruction from Fourier data},

abstract = {Minimization of the wiring cost of white matter fibers in the human brain appears to be an organizational principle. We investigate this aspect in the human brain using whole brain connectivity networks extracted from high resolution diffusion MRI data of 14 normal volunteers. We specifically address the question of whether brain anatomy determines its connectivity or vice versa. Unlike previous studies we use weighted networks, where connections between cortical nodes are real-valued rather than binary off-on connections. In one set of analyses we found that the connectivity structure of the brain has near optimal wiring cost compared to random networks with the same number of edges, degree distribution and edge weight distribution. A specifically designed minimization routine could not find cheaper wiring without significantly degrading network performance. In another set of analyses we kept the observed brain network topology and connectivity but allowed nodes to freely move on a 3D manifold topologically identical to the brain. An efficient minimization routine was written to find the lowest wiring cost configuration. We found that beginning from any random configuration, the nodes invariably arrange themselves in a configuration with a striking resemblance to the brain. This confirms the widely held but poorly tested claim that wiring economy is a driving principle of the brain. Intriguingly, our results also suggest that the brain mainly optimizes for the most desirable network connectivity, and the observed brain anatomy is merely a result of this optimization.},

abstract = {Imaging of water diffusion using magnetic resonance imaging has become an important noninvasive method for probing the white matter connectivity of the human brain for scientific and clinical studies. Current methods, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) such as q-ball imaging, and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), are limited by low spatial resolution, long scan times, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These methods fundamentally perform reconstruction on a voxel-by-voxel level, effectively discarding the natural coherence of the data at different points in space. This paper attempts to overcome these tradeoffs by using spatial information to constrain the reconstruction from raw diffusion MRI data, and thereby improve angular resolution and noise tolerance. Spatial constraints are specified in terms of a prior probability distribution, which is then incorporated in a Bayesian reconstruction formulation. By taking the log of the resulting posterior distribution, optimal Bayesian reconstruction is reduced to a cost minimization problem. The minimization is solved using a new iterative algorithm based on successive least squares quadratic descent. Simulation studies and in vivo results are presented which indicate significant gains in terms of higher angular resolution of diffusion orientation distribution functions, better separation of crossing fibers, and improved reconstruction SNR over the same HARDI method, spherical harmonic q-ball imaging, without spatial regularization. Preliminary data also indicate that the proposed method might be better at maintaining accurate ODFs for smaller numbers of diffusion-weighted acquisition directions (hence faster scans) compared to conventional methods. Possible impacts of this work include improved evaluation of white matter microstructural integrity in regions of crossing fibers and higher spatial and angular resolution for more accurate tractography.},

abstract = {Patterns of dementia are known to fall into dissociated but dispersed brain networks, suggesting that the disease is transmitted along neuronal pathways rather than by proximity. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence for "prion-like" transsynaptic transmission of disease agents like misfolded tau and beta amyloid. We mathematically model this transmission by a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain's connectivity network obtained from tractography of 14 healthy-brain MRIs. Subsequent graph theoretic analysis provides a fully quantitative, testable, predictive model of dementia. Specifically, we predict spatially distinct "persistent modes," which, we found, recapitulate known patterns of dementia and match recent reports of selectively vulnerable dissociated brain networks. Model predictions also closely match T1-weighted MRI volumetrics of 18 Alzheimer's and 18 frontotemporal dementia subjects. Prevalence rates predicted by the model strongly agree with published data. This work has many important implications, including dimensionality reduction, differential diagnosis, and especially prediction of future atrophy using baseline MRI morphometrics.},

Accordingly, we present a short review of network models of spread, network dynamics, and network degeneration.

abstract = {Existing parallel MRI methods are limited by a fundamental trade-off in that suppressing noise introduces aliasing artifacts. Bayesian methods with an appropriately chosen image prior offer a promising alternative; however, previous methods with spatial priors assume that intensities vary smoothly over the entire image, resulting in blurred edges. Here we introduce an edge-preserving prior (EPP) that instead assumes that intensities are piecewise smooth, and propose a new approach to efficiently compute its Bayesian estimate. The estimation task is formulated as an optimization problem that requires a nonconvex objective function to be minimized in a space with thousands of dimensions. As a result, traditional continuous minimization methods cannot be applied. This optimization task is closely related to some problems in the field of computer vision for which discrete optimization methods have been developed in the last few years. We adapt these algorithms, which are based on graph cuts, to address our optimization problem. The results of several parallel imaging experiments on brain and torso regions performed under challenging conditions with high acceleration factors are shown and compared with the results of conventional sensitivity encoding (SENSE) methods. An empirical analysis indicates that the proposed method visually improves overall quality compared to conventional methods.},

abstract = {Parallel imaging is a powerful technique to speed up magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition via multiple coils. Both the received signal of each coil and its sensitivity map, which describes its spatial response, are needed during reconstruction. Widely used schemes such as SENSE assume that sensitivity maps of the coils are noiseless while the only errors are in coil outputs. In practice, however, sensitivity maps are subject to a wide variety of errors. At first glance, sensitivity noise appears to result in an errors-in-variables problem of the kind that is typically solved using total least squares (TLSs). However, existing TLS algorithms are in general inappropriate for the specific type of block structure that arises in parallel imaging. In this paper, we take a maximum likelihood approach to the problem of parallel imaging in the presence of independent Gaussian sensitivity noise. This results in a quasi-quadratic objective function, which can be efficiently minimized. Experimental evidence suggests substantial gains over conventional SENSE, especially in nonideal imaging conditions like low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), high g-factors and large acceleration, using sensitivity maps suffering from misalignment, ringing, and random noise.},

abstract = {Time-resolved contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may suffer from involuntary patient motion. It is noted that while MR signal change associated with motion is large in magnitude and has smooth phase variation in k-phase, signal change associated with vascular enhancement is small in magnitude and has rapid phase variation in k-space. Based upon this observation, a novel projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm is developed as an automatic iterative method to remove motion artifacts. The presented POCS algorithm consists of high-pass phase filtering and convex projections in both k-space and image space. Without input of detailed motion knowledge, motion effects are filtered out, while vasculature information is preserved. The proposed method can be effective for a large class of nonrigid motions, including through-plane motion. The algorithm is stable and converges quickly, usually within five iterations. A double-blind evaluation on a set of clinical MRA cases shows that a completely unsupervised version of the algorithm produces significantly better rank scores (P=0.038) when compared to angiograms produced manually by an experienced radiologist.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lack of clear understanding remains on the overlapping atrophy patterns of aging and early Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in gray matter (GM) of the brain in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the independent and overlapping patterns of GM atrophy in normal aging and AD. METHODS: A total of 169 cognitively normal subjects and 33 persons with probable AD enrolled in the longitudinal Cardiovascular Health Study-Cognition Study underwent 3-dimensional volumetric MRI scans. Controls remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their MRI scans and the probable AD subjects were relatively early in their clinical course with an average modified Mini-Mental State Examination score of 76/100. The scans were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry adjusting for total intracranial volume, gender, education, and race. RESULTS: With older age, GM volume was lower in the sensorimotor and heteromodal association areas in frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes, as well as in the cerebellum (false discovery rate p = 0.05). Additional atrophy was observed in the posterior hippocampus, thalamus, and middle cingulate gyrus. By contrast, atrophy was seen in subjects with AD in the anterior hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and the precuneus. Normal aging and AD overlapped in the hippocampal body and the entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSION: Brain atrophy with aging was observed in supratentorial and infratentorial areas, as well in primary motor, sensory, and heteromodal association regions. Age and Alzheimer disease exert independent gray matter atrophy patterns but these effects overlapped substantially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.},

Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated activation of oxidative stress pathways following blast injury, but their distribution among different brain regions and their impact on the pathogenesis of bTBI have not been explored. The present study examined the protein expression of two isoforms: NADPH oxidase 1 and 2 (NOX1, NOX2), corresponding superoxide production, a downstream event of NOX activation, and the extent of lipid peroxidation adducts of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) to a range of proteins. Brain injury was evaluated 4 hours after the shock wave exposure, and immunofluorescence signal quantification was performed in different brain regions. Expression of NOX isoforms displayed a differential increase in various brain regions: in hippocampus and thalamus, there was the highest increase of NOX1, whereas in the frontal cortex there was the highest increase of NOX2 expression. Cell-specific analysis of changes in NOX expression with respect to corresponding controls revealed that blast resulted in a higher increase of NOX1 and NOX 2 levels in neurons compared to astrocytes and microglia. Blast exposure also resulted in increased superoxide levels in different brain regions, and such changes were reflected in 4HNE protein adduct formation. Collectively, this study demonstrates that primary blast TBI induces upregulation of NADPH oxidase isoforms in different regions of the brain parenchyma and that neurons appear to be at higher risk for oxidative damage compared to other neural cells.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the pattern of brain atrophy across time in a sample of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with and without dementia using voxelbased morphometry (VBM) analysis. METHODS The initial sample comprised thirteen non-demented PD patients and sixteen demented patients. Longitudinal cognitive assessment and structural MRI were performed. The mean follow-up period was 25 months (SD=5.2). From this initial group, eight PD patients with dementia (5 men and 3 women) and eleven PD patients without dementia (7 men and 4 women) were reevaluated. MRI 3D structural images were acquired and analyzed by means of the optimized VBM procedure with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM2). RESULTS VBM analysis showed a progressive grey matter volume decrease in patients with PD without dementia in limbic, paralimbic and neocortical associative temporooccipital regions. In patients with dementia the loss mainly involved neocortical regions. CONCLUSION VBM revealed a significant loss of grey matter volume in PD patients with and without dementia with disease progression. The decrease in limbic and paralimbic regions is widespread in non-demented patients. Neocortical volume reduction is the most relevant finding in patients with dementia. This suggests that the neocortex is a substrate for dementia in Parkinson disease.},

abstract = {Disruption of fast axonal transport (FAT) is an early pathological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble amyloid-$\beta$ oligomers (A$\beta$Os), increasingly recognized as proximal neurotoxins in AD, impair organelle transport in cultured neurons and transgenic mouse models. A$\beta$Os also stimulate hyperphosphorylation of the axonal microtubule-associated protein, tau. However, the role of tau in FAT disruption is controversial. Here we show that A$\beta$Os reduce vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal neurons from both wild-type and tau-knockout mice, indicating that tau is not required for transport disruption. FAT inhibition is not accompanied by microtubule destabilization or neuronal death. Significantly, inhibition of calcineurin (CaN), a calcium-dependent phosphatase implicated in AD pathogenesis, rescues BDNF transport. Moreover, inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3$\beta$, downstream targets of CaN, prevents BDNF transport defects induced by A$\beta$Os. We further show that A$\beta$Os induce CaN activation through nonexcitotoxic calcium signaling. Results implicate CaN in FAT regulation and demonstrate that tau is not required for A$\beta$O-induced BDNF transport disruption.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other degenerative early-onset dementias in a geographically defined population. BACKGROUND: Early-onset dementia (at age <65 years) results in high psychiatric morbidity and caregiver burden. Prevalence figures are available for early-onset AD but not for FTD, a dementia that is almost invariably of early onset. METHODS: Case ascertainment was by review of case records of three specialist clinic databases and inpatient admissions at a university hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom, for patients with dementia who were <65 years of age, living in Cambridge City or East or South Cambridgeshire (population 326,019) on May 30, 2000. All the relevant health services in the area were also contacted for potential cases. Diagnosis of various dementias was based on published criteria. All patients with potential FTD were examined by the study investigators and underwent structural neuroimaging. The 1998 population estimates for the area were used to calculate age and sex prevalence with confidence intervals for AD, FTD, and other causes of dementia. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients (66 men and 42 women) with dementia with onset before they were 65 years of age were identified, of whom 60 were <65 years on the census date, giving an overall prevalence of 81 (95% CI, 62.8 to 104.5) per 100,000 in the 45- to 64-year age group. The prevalences of early-onset FTD and AD were the same: 15 per 100,000 (8.4 to 27.0) in the 45- to 64-year-old population. The mean age at onset of FTD was 52.8 years and there was a striking male preponderance (14:3). It is possible case ascertainment methods resulted in a relative underrepresentation of some forms of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Frontotemporal dementia is a more common cause of early-onset dementia than previously recognized and appears to be more common in men.},

abstract = {Background: Iron can catalyze damaging free radical reactions. With age, iron accumulates in brain gray matter regions and may contribute to the risk of developing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior MRI studies demonstrated increased iron deposits in basal ganglia regions; however, the hippocampus (Hipp), which is heavily damaged in AD, and comparator regions that are resistant to AD damage, such as thalamus (Th), have rarely been examined. Objective: To assess iron levels and evidence of tissue damage in Hipp and Th of AD subjects and healthy controls. Methods: Thirty-one AD and sixty-eight healthy control subjects participated in this study. High- and low-field strength MRI instruments were used in combination to quantify iron content of ferritin molecules (ferritin iron) using the field dependent relaxation rate increase (FDRI) method. Decreased transverse relaxation rate (R2) was used as an index of tissue damage. Results: Compared with healthy controls, AD subjects had increased ferritin iron in Hipp (p = 0.019) but not Th (p = 0.637), and significantly decreased R2 in Hipp (p < 0.001) but not Th (p = 0.37). In the entire sample, FDRI and R2 were negatively correlated. Conclusion: The data shows that in AD, Hipp damage occurs in conjunction with ferritin iron accumulation. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate how increasing iron levels may influence the trajectory of tissue damage and cognitive and pathologic manifestations of AD.},

Extensive research of AD postmortem brains, mouse and fly models, including triple transgenic AD mice and mutant tau mice, and cell culture studies revealed that tau hyperphosphorylation is caused by multiple factors, including intraneuronal A$\beta$-oligomers, chronic oxidative stress, reduced insulin-like growth factor 1, and astrocytic mediated-A$\beta$ and caspase activation. Overexpressed and phosphorylated tau appears to impair axonal transport of organelles causing synapse starvation, depletion of ATP, and ultimately neuronal damage.

@article{Reid2016,
abstract = {In systems neuroscience, the term "connectivity" has been defined in numerous ways, according to the particular empirical modality from which it is derived. Due to large differences in the phenomena measured by these modalities, the assumptions necessary to make inferences about axonal connections, and the limitations accompanying each, brain connectivity remains an elusive concept. Despite this, only a handful of studies have directly compared connectivity as inferred from multiple modalities, and there remains much ambiguity over what the term is actually referring to as a biological construct. Here, we perform a direct comparison based on the high-resolution and high-contrast Enhanced Nathan Klein Institute (NKI) Rockland Sample neuroimaging data set, and the CoCoMac database of tract tracing studies. We compare four types of commonly-used primate connectivity analyses: tract tracing experiments, compiled in CoCoMac; group-wise correlation of cortical thickness; tractographic networks computed from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI); and correlational networks obtained from resting-state BOLD (fMRI). We find generally poor correspondence between all four modalities, in terms of correlated edge weights, binarized comparisons of thresholded networks, and clustering patterns. fMRI and DWI had the best agreement, followed by DWI and CoCoMac, while other comparisons showed striking divergence. Networks had the best correspondence for local ipsilateral and homotopic contralateral connections, and the worst correspondence for long-range and heterotopic contralateral connections. k-Means clustering highlighted the lowest cross-modal and cross-species consensus in lateral and medial temporal lobes, anterior cingulate, and the temporoparietal junction. Comparing the NKI results to those of the lower resolution/contrast International Consortium for Brain Imaging (ICBM) dataset, we find that the relative pattern of intermodal relationships is preserved, but the correspondence between human imaging connectomes is substantially better for NKI. These findings caution against using "connectivity" as an umbrella term for results derived from single empirical modalities, and suggest that any interpretation of these results should account for (and ideally help explain) the lack of multimodal correspondence.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the relation of amyloid and tau pathology in the hippocampal formation to decline in memory and other cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS Regression models were used to relate semiquantitative measurements of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs) at autopsy with antemortem performance in memory, abstract/visuospatial and language domains in two independent samples (n = 41, n = 66) that had repeated neuropsychological measurements before death. RESULTS In both groups, the number of NFTs in the entorhinal cortex, subiculum and CA1 region was inversely associated with memory performance at the last visit before death. However, the number of amyloid plaques and NTs in the entorhinal cortex was also inversely related to poor memory function. Moreover, as the number of plaques or NTs increased in any region of the hippocampal formation, there was a more rapid decline in memory performance over time; a similar decline was associated with increasing numbers of NFTs in the CA1 or subiculum. In contrast, there was no association between amyloid plaques, NFTs or NTs in the frontal or parietal lobe and performance in memory, nor was there an association between plaques, NFTs or NTs in the hippocampal formation and cognitive functions unrelated to memory. DISCUSSION This study implicates both amyloid deposition and tau pathology in the hippocampus as an early and late cause of decline in memory function over time in AD. Memory performance appears to be specifically related to the amount of amyloid plaques, NFTs and NTs in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.},

It proposes that the deposition of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) is the initial pathological event in AD leading to the formation of senile plaques (SPs) and then to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal cell death, and ultimately dementia. While there is substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis, there are also limitations: (1) SP and NFT may develop independently, and (2) SPs and NFTs may be the products rather than the causes of neurodegeneration in AD. In addition, randomized clinical trials that tested drugs or antibodies targeting components of the amyloid pathway have been inconclusive.

abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

The aggregates are believed to propagate via neural pathways following a stereotypical pattern, starting in the olfactory bulb (OB) and gut. We hypothesized that injection of fibrillar ?-syn into the OB of wild-type mice would recreate the sequential progression of Lewy-like pathology, while triggering olfactory deficits. We demonstrate that injected ?-syn fibrils recruit endogenous ?-syn into pathological aggregates that spread transneuronally over several months, initially in the olfactory network and later in distant brain regions. The seeded inclusions contain posttranslationally modified ?-syn that is Thioflavin S positive, indicative of amyloid fibrils. The spreading ?-syn pathology induces progressive and specific olfactory deficits. Thus, we demonstrate that propagating ?-syn pathology triggered in the OB is functionally detrimental. Collectively, we have created a mouse model of prodromal PD.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In neuroscience, as in many other scientific domains, the primary form of knowledge dissemination is through published articles. One challenge for modern neuroinformatics is finding methods to make the knowledge from the tremendous backlog of publications accessible for search, analysis and the integration of such data into computational models. A key example of this is metascale brain connectivity, where results are not reported in a normalized repository. Instead, these experimental results are published in natural language, scattered among individual scientific publications. This lack of normalization and centralization hinders the large-scale integration of brain connectivity results. In this article, we present text-mining models to extract and aggregate brain connectivity results from 13.2 million PubMed abstracts and 630 216 full-text publications related to neuroscience. The brain regions are identified with three different named entity recognizers (NERs) and then normalized against two atlases: the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) and the atlas from the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). We then use three different extractors to assess inter-region connectivity. RESULTS: NERs and connectivity extractors are evaluated against a manually annotated corpus. The complete in litero extraction models are also evaluated against in vivo connectivity data from ABA with an estimated precision of 78%. The resulting database contains over 4 million brain region mentions and over 100 000 (ABA) and 122 000 (BAMS) potential brain region connections. This database drastically accelerates connectivity literature review, by providing a centralized repository of connectivity data to neuroscientists.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no cure. Most patients suffer from sporadic PD, which is likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Braak's hypothesis states that sporadic PD is caused by a pathogen that enters the body via the nasal cavity, and subsequently is swallowed and reaches the gut, initiating Lewy pathology (LP) in the nose and the digestive tract. A staging system describing the spread of LP from the peripheral to the central nervous system was also postulated by the same research group. There has been criticism to Braak's hypothesis, in part because not all patients follow the proposed staging system. Here, we review literature that either supports or criticizes Braak's hypothesis, focused on the enteric route, digestive problems in patients, the spread of LP on a tissue and a cellular level, and the toxicity of the protein $\alpha$Synuclein ($\alpha$Syn), which is the major constituent of LP. We conclude that Braak's hypothesis is supported by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence. However, we also conclude that the staging system of Braak only describes a specific subset of patients with young onset and long duration of the disease.},

abstract = {Neuronal inclusion of transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is known to be a pathologic hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43, which is physiologically a nuclear protein, is mislocalized from the nucleus and aggregated within the cytoplasm of affected neurons in ALS and FTLD patients. Neuropathologic or experimental studies have addressed mechanisms underlying spreading of TDP-43 inclusions in the central nervous system of ALS and FTLD patients. On the basis of postmortem observations, it is hypothesized that TDP-43 inclusions spread along the neural projections. A centrifugal gradient of TDP-43 pathology in certain anatomical systems and axonal or synaptic aggregation of TDP-43 may support the hypothesis. Experimental studies have revealed cell-to-cell propagation of aggregated or truncated TDP-43, which indicates a direct transmission of TDP-43 inclusions to contiguous cells. However, discrepancies remain between the cell-to-cell propagation suggested in the experimental models and the anatomical spreading of TDP-43 aggregations based on postmortem observations. Transsynaptic transmission, rather than the direct cell-to-cell transmission, may be consistent with the anatomical spreading of TDP-43 aggregations, but cellular mechanisms of transsynaptic transmission of aggregated proteins remain to be elucidated. Moreover, the spreading of TDP-43 inclusions varies among patients and genetic backgrounds, which indicates host-dependent factors for spreading of TDP-43 aggregations. Perturbation of cellular TDP-43 clearance may be a possible factor modifying the aggregation and spreading. This review discusses postmortem and experimental evidence that address mechanisms of spreading of TDP-43 pathology in the central nervous system of ALS and FTLD patients.},

abstract = {Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the association of APOE with amyloid deposition, cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) of A$\beta$, tau, and p-tau, brain atrophy, cognition and cognitive complaints in E-MCI patients and cognitively healthy older adults (HC) in the ADNI-2 cohort. Methods: Two-hundred and nine E-MCI and 123 HC participants from the ADNI-2 cohort were included. We evaluated the impact of diagnostic status (E-MCI vs. HC) and APOE $\epsilon$4 status ($\epsilon$4 positive vs. $\epsilon$4 negative) on cortical amyloid deposition (AV-45/Florbetapir SUVR PET scans), brain atrophy (structural MRI scans processed using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer version 5.1), CSF levels of A$\beta$, tau, and p-tau, and cognitive performance and complaints. Results: E-MCI participants showed significantly impaired cognition, higher levels of cognitive complaints, greater levels of tau and p-tau, and subcortical and cortical atrophy relative to HC participants (p < 0.05). Cortical amyloid deposition and CSF levels of A$\beta$ were significantly associated with APOE $\epsilon$4 status but not E-MCI diagnosis, with $\epsilon$4 positive participants showing more amyloid deposition and lower levels of CSF A$\beta$ than $\epsilon$4 negative participants. Other effects of APOE $\epsilon$4 status on cognition and CSF tau levels were also observed. Conclusions: APOE $\epsilon$4 status is associated with amyloid accumulation and lower CSF A$\beta$, as well as increased CSF tau levels in early prodromal stages of AD (E-MCI) and HC. Alternatively, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and increased complaints are primarily associated with a diagnosis of E-MCI. These findings underscore the importance of considering APOE genotype when evaluating biomarkers in early stages of disease.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multi-center study assessing neuroimaging in diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring. Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a prodromal form of dementia, conferring a 10-15% annual risk of converting to probable AD. We analyzed baseline 1.5T MRI scans in 693 participants from the ADNI cohort divided into four groups by baseline diagnosis and one year MCI to probable AD conversion status to identify neuroimaging phenotypes associated with MCI and AD and potential predictive markers of imminent conversion. MP-RAGE scans were analyzed using publicly available voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automated parcellation methods. Measures included global and hippocampal grey matter (GM) density, hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, and cortical thickness values from entorhinal cortex and other temporal and parietal lobe regions. The overall pattern of structural MRI changes in MCI (n=339) and AD (n=148) compared to healthy controls (HC, n=206) was similar to prior findings in smaller samples. MCI-Converters (n=62) demonstrated a very similar pattern of atrophic changes to the AD group up to a year before meeting clinical criteria for AD. Finally, a comparison of effect sizes for contrasts between the MCI-Converters and MCI-Stable (n=277) groups on MRI metrics indicated that degree of neurodegeneration of medial temporal structures was the best antecedent MRI marker of imminent conversion, with decreased hippocampal volume (left > right) being the most robust. Validation of imaging biomarkers is important as they can help enrich clinical trials of disease modifying agents by identifying individuals at highest risk for progression to AD.},

Linear regression models indicated an individual's conversion status was significantly associated with certain baseline neuroimaging measures, including posterior cingulate glucose metabolism. Linear Discriminant Analysis models built with baseline features derived from MRI and FDG-PET measures were capable of successfully predicting whether an individual will convert to MCI within 48 months or remain cognitively stable. The findings from this study support the idea that there exist informative differences between normal people who will later develop cognitive impairments and those who will remain cognitively stable for up to four years. Further, the feasibility of developing predictive models that can detect early states of cognitive decline in seemingly normal individuals was demonstrated.},

abstract = {The emergence of longevity in the modern world has brought a sense of urgency to understanding age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus regarding the correlation between the pathological substrates of neurodegeneration and dementia status, particularly in the oldest-old. To better understand the pathological correlates of dementia in the oldest-old, we characterized the topographical spread and severity of amyloid-$\beta$, tau, TDP-43 and $\alpha$-synuclein pathologies in the 90+ Study, a prospective longitudinal population-based study of ageing and dementia. Neuropathological analysis with immunohistochemically labelled sections was carried out blind to clinical diagnosis on the first 108 participants of the 90+ Study who came to autopsy including participants with dementia (n = 66) and without dementia (n = 42). We used quantitative and/or semi-quantitative measures to assess the burden of amyloid-$\beta$, tau, TDP-43 and $\alpha$-synuclein pathologies as well as hippocampal sclerosis. Amyloid-$\beta$ and tau were the predominant pathologies in the 90+ Study cohort and both amyloid-$\beta$ area and tau area occupied measures were strongly associated with the presence of dementia, as was Braak staging but semi-quantitative plaque scores were not. Notably, TDP-43 pathology also correlated with dementia, while $\alpha$-synuclein distribution did not. In addition, hippocampal sclerosis was specific to participants with dementia and correlated with the presence of limbic TDP-43. In contrast to previous reports, we found that tau and amyloid-$\beta$ continue to be robust pathological correlates of dementia, even in the oldest-old. While individuals with no dementia had limited hippocampal tau and neocortical amyloid-$\beta$ pathology, dementia associated with an expansion in pathology, including increased neocortical tau and hippocampal amyloid-$\beta$ plaques, more abundant neocortical amyloid-$\beta$ deposition and hippocampal sclerosis with its attendant TDP-43 pathology.},

However, despite extensive use of the FDG-PET method, the significance of the measured CMRglc has been little addressed so far. In the present study, we aimed for the first time to test whether resting-state CMRglc is directly related to synaptic density. To this end, we investigated in the baboon the relationships between CMR(glc) and the levels of synaptophysin (SY), a presynaptic protein classically used to assess synaptic density. CMR(glc), measured in vivo by FDG-PET at the resting-state, and SY levels, assessed postmortem by the Western blot technique, were quantified in seven brain areas of five baboons. By applying these two techniques to the same animals, we found significant positive correlations between CMR(glc) and SY levels, across all regions and all animals, as well as within individual baboons. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that resting-state CMR(glc) reflects integrated synaptic activity.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Before these hallmark features appear, signs of axonal transport defects develop, though the initiating events are not clear. Enhanced amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays an integral role in AD pathogenesis, and previous work suggests that both the A$\beta$ region and the C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP can cause transport defects. However, it remains unknown if APP processing affects the axonal transport of APP itself, and whether increased APP processing is sufficient to promote axonal dystrophy. We tested the hypothesis that $\beta$-secretase cleavage site mutations of APP alter APP axonal transport directly. We found that the enhanced $\beta$-secretase cleavage reduces the anterograde axonal transport of APP, while inhibited $\beta$-cleavage stimulates APP anterograde axonal transport. Transport behavior of APP after treatment with $\beta$- or $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors suggests that the amount of $\beta$-secretase cleaved CTFs ($\beta$CTFs) of APP underlies these transport differences. Consistent with these findings, $\beta$CTFs have reduced anterograde axonal transport compared with full-length, wild-type APP. Finally, a gene-targeted mouse with familial AD (FAD) Swedish mutations to APP, which enhance the $\beta$-cleavage of APP, develops axonal dystrophy in the absence of mutant protein overexpression, amyloid plaque deposition and synaptic degradation. These results suggest that the enhanced $\beta$-secretase processing of APP can directly impair the anterograde axonal transport of APP and are sufficient to lead to axonal defects in vivo.},

abstract = {Phosphorylated forms of microtubule-associated protein tau accumulate in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the effects of specific phosphorylated tau residues on its function, wild type or phosphomutant tau was expressed in cells. Elevated tau phosphorylation decreased its microtubule binding and bundling, and increased the number of motile tau particles, without affecting axonal transport kinetics. In contrast, reducing tau phosphorylation enhanced the amount of tau bound to microtubules and inhibited axonal transport of tau. To determine whether differential tau clearance is responsible for the increase in phosphomimic tau, we inhibited autophagy in neurons which resulted in a 3-fold accumulation of phosphomimic tau compared with wild type tau, and endogenous tau was unaffected. In autophagy-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but not in neurons, proteasomal degradation of phosphomutant tau was also reduced compared with wild type tau. Therefore, autophagic and proteasomal pathways are involved in tau degradation, with autophagy appearing to be the primary route for clearing phosphorylated tau in neurons. Defective autophagy might contribute to the accumulaton of tau in neurodegenerative diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors, including cognitive and brain reserve, which may independently predict prevalent and incident dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and to determine whether inclusion of identified factors increases the predictive accuracy of the CSF biomarkers A$\beta$(42), tau, ptau(181), tau/A$\beta$(42), and ptau(181)/A$\beta$(42). METHODS: Logistic regression identified variables that predicted prevalent DAT when considered together with each CSF biomarker in a cross-sectional sample of 201 participants with normal cognition and 46 with DAT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from the resulting model was compared with the AUC generated using the biomarker alone. In a second sample with normal cognition at baseline and longitudinal data available (n = 213), Cox proportional hazards models identified variables that predicted incident DAT together with each biomarker, and the models' concordance probability estimate (CPE), which was compared to the CPE generated using the biomarker alone. RESULTS: APOE genotype including an $\epsilon$4 allele, male gender, and smaller normalized whole brain volumes (nWBV) were cross-sectionally associated with DAT when considered together with every biomarker. In the longitudinal sample (mean follow-up = 3.2 years), 14 participants (6.6%) developed DAT. Older age predicted a faster time to DAT in every model, and greater education predicted a slower time in 4 of 5 models. Inclusion of ancillary variables resulted in better cross-sectional prediction of DAT for all biomarkers (p < 0.0021), and better longitudinal prediction for 4 of 5 biomarkers (p < 0.0022). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of CSF biomarkers is improved by including age, education, and nWBV in analyses.},

We have generated a transgenic mouse model, TgAPParc, with neuron-specific expression of human amyloid precursor protein with the Arctic mutation (hAPParc), showing mild amyloid pathology with a relatively late onset. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal progression of neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc, focusing on intracellular A$\beta$ and diffuse A$\beta$ aggregates rather than amyloid plaques. We show that the neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc mice starts with intracellular A$\beta$ aggregates, which is followed by diffuse extracellular A$\beta$ deposits in subiculum that later expands to brain regions receiving neuronal projections from regions already affected. Together this suggests that the pathology in TgAPParc mice affects interconnected brain regions and may represent a valuable tool to study the spread and progression of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease.},

The two cortices are further projected upon by fibers from the supramamillary region of the hypothalamus, the ventral tegmental area of the mesencephalon, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the nucleus centralis superior, and the locus coeruleus. The entorhinal cortex, in addition, receives projections from the medial septum. As regards the projections from the amygdaloid complex, it was observed that the entorhinal cortex receives its heaviest input from the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, whereas the perirhinal cortex receives a strong projection from the lateral nucleus and a weaker projection from the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala. Of the thalamic nuclei that project to the parahippocampal cortex, the nucleus reuniens is only connected with the entorhinal cortex, while fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus and the lateral posterior nucleus terminate in the perirhinal cortex. Injections of tritiated amino acid (3H-leucine) were placed in the medial septum, the dorsal and ventral claustrum, the basolateral and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. The results of these experiments demonstrate that, with the exception of the claustrum, these subcortical areas project mainly to the superficial layers I-III and the lamina dissecans of the parahippocampal cortex, and to a lesser degree to the deep layers V and VI.},

abstract = {The clinical phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) is far more complex and variable than depictions of it as a progressive movement disorder dominated by neostriatal pathology represent. The availability of novel neuro-imaging methods has enabled us to evaluate cerebral cortical changes in HD, which we have found to occur early and to be topographically selective. What is less clear, however, is how these changes influence the clinical expression of the disease. In this study, we used a high-resolution surface based analysis of in vivo MRI data to measure cortical thickness in 33 individuals with HD, spanning the spectrum of disease and 22 age- and sex-matched controls. We found close relationships between specific functional and cognitive measures and topologically specific cortical regions. We also found that distinct motor phenotypes were associated with discrete patterns of cortical thinning. The selective topographical associations of cortical thinning with clinical features of HD suggest that we are not simply correlating global worsening with global cortical degeneration. Our results indicate that cortical involvement contributes to important symptoms, including those that have been ascribed primarily to the striatum, and that topologically selective changes in the cortex might explain much of the clinical heterogeneity found in HD. Additionally, a significant association between regional cortical thinning and total functional capacity, currently the leading primary outcome measure used in neuroprotection trials for HD, establishes cortical MRI morphometry as a potential biomarker of disease progression.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate microstructural changes in cortical and white matter pathways in patients with Alzheimer's disease using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measures of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared in the brains of 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and a group of 13 aged-matched control participants employing an optimized DTI technique involving a fully automated, voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. RESULTS: After rigorous control for anatomical variation and confounding partial volume effects, we found significantly elevated MD measures within the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe gray matter regions in the AD participants. The largest number of pixels with increased MD was localized bilaterally, within the posterior cingulate gyrus. The FA was significantly reduced within the thalamus, parietal white matter, and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, indicating significant involvement of corticothalamic and thalamocortical radiations. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that rigorous VBM analysis of DTI data can be used to investigate microstructural changes in cortical, subcortical, and white matter regions in AD.},

abstract = {Summary The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for adaptive motor control, but the circuit principles underlying their pathway-specific modulation of target regions are not well understood. Here, we dissect the mechanisms underlying BG direct and indirect pathway-mediated control of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), a brainstem target of BG that is critical for locomotion. We optogenetically dissect the locomotor function of the three neurochemically distinct cell types within the MLR: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons. We find that the glutamatergic subpopulation encodes locomotor state and speed, is necessary and sufficient for locomotion, and is selectively innervated by BG. We further show activation and suppression, respectively, of MLR glutamatergic neurons by direct and indirect pathways, which is required for bidirectional control of locomotion by BG circuits. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how BG can initiate or suppress a motor program through cell-type-specific regulation of neurons linked to specific actions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) often have Alzheimer disease (AD) at autopsy, yet are cognitively and anatomically distinct from patients with clinical AD. We sought to compare the distribution of $\beta$-amyloid and glucose metabolism in PCA and AD in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and FDG-PET. METHODS: Patients with PCA (n = 12, age 57.5 ± 7.4, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 22.2 ± 5.1), AD (n = 14, age 58.8 ± 9.6, MMSE 23.8 ± 6.7), and cognitively normal controls (NC, n = 30, age 73.6 ± 6.4) underwent PiB and FDG-PET. Group differences in PiB distribution volume ratios (DVR, cerebellar reference) and FDG uptake (pons-averaged) were assessed on a voxel-wise basis and by comparing binding in regions of interest (ROIs). RESULTS: Compared to NC, both patients with AD and patients with PCA showed diffuse PiB uptake throughout frontal, temporoparietal, and occipital cortex (p < 0.0001). There were no regional differences in PiB binding between PCA and AD even after correcting for atrophy. FDG patterns in PCA and AD were distinct: while both groups showed hypometabolism compared to NC in temporoparietal cortex and precuneus/posterior cingulate, patients with PCA further showed hypometabolism in inferior occipitotemporal cortex compared to both NC and patients with AD (p < 0.05). Patients with AD did not show areas of relative hypometabolism compared to PCA. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrillar amyloid deposition in PCA is diffuse and similar to AD, while glucose hypometabolism extends more posteriorly into occipital cortex. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms of selective network degeneration in focal variants of AD.},

Three early onset forms of AD inherited as autosomal dominant traits account for less than 2% of prevalent AD. A major susceptibility locus, apolipoprotein E (APOE, gene; apoE, protein) is associated with risk and age of onset distributions for the common familial and sporadic late-onset AD. The identification of additional genetic susceptibility genes in the etiology of AD and the metabolic mechanisms leading to differences in age of onset and disease pathogenesis are active areas of current research.},

abstract = {The cross-sectional analyses currently available show that the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cytoskeletal alterations within the human brain affect variously susceptible areas of the cerebral cortex in a uniform sequence with very little interpatient variability. This sequence has been divided for research and comparative purposes into six stages (cortical NFT/NT-stages I-VI). Among the subcortical nuclei affected in AD are those belonging to the raphe system. Efforts were focused on the lesions present in these nuclei to see in which of the six stages the AD-related cytoskeletal anomalies begin and whether a correlation exists between the AD-related pathology developing within the cerebral cortex and the cytoskeletal damage that occurs in the nuclei of the raphe system. To this end, serial sections from the brainstems of 27 post-mortem cases with stages I-VI of cortical cytoskeletal lesions were examined. The cytoskeletal pathology was visualized using the modified silver iodide-Gallyas staining technique and the antibody AT8. The latter is directed specifically against the abnormally phosphorylated cytoskeletal protein tau. The dorsal raphe nucleus manifests the cytoskeletal lesions early on (stages I-II). The central and linear raphe nuclei, by contrast, do so initially in stages III-IV, and the caudal raphe nuclei register the first changes in stages V-VI. In stages V and VI, the dorsal raphe nucleus displays the most severe cytoskeletal pathology within the raphe system, followed by the central and linear raphe nuclei, whereas the cytoskeletal anomalies in the caudal raphe nuclei are slight. The developing damage within the nuclei of the raphe system correlates with the stages I-VI and, furthermore, progresses in the oral raphe nuclei in close connection with the evolution of the pathological process in cortical projection destinations of these nuclei. As the source of the ascending serotonergic system, the involvement of the oral raphe nuclei may be partially responsible for the early manifestation of the non-cognitive and emotional deficiencies possibly traceable to dysfunctions within the ascending serotonergic system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly evident that deficits in the cortex and hippocampus at early stages of dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with synaptic damage caused by oligomers of the toxic amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$42). However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms behind these deficits are not fully understood. Here we provide evidence of a mechanism by which A$\beta$42 affects synaptic transmission regulating neurotransmitter release. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We first showed that application of 50 nM A$\beta$42 in cultured neurones is followed by its internalisation and translocation to synaptic contacts. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that with time, A$\beta$42 can be detected at the presynaptic terminals where it interacts with Synaptophysin. Furthermore, data from dissociated hippocampal neurons as well as biochemical data provide evidence that A$\beta$42 disrupts the complex formed between Synaptophysin and VAMP2 increasing the amount of primed vesicles and exocytosis. Finally, electrophysiology recordings in brain slices confirmed that A$\beta$42 affects baseline transmission. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our observations provide a necessary and timely insight into cellular mechanisms that underlie the initial pathological events that lead to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate a new mechanism by which A$\beta$42 affects synaptic activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traumatic axonal injury is a primary brain abnormality in head trauma and is characterized by reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our hypothesis was that patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have widespread brain white matter regions of reduced FA involving a variety of fiber bundles and show fiber disruption on fiber tracking in a minority of these regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Twenty-one patients with mild TBI were investigated (men:women, 12:9; mean age +/- SD, 32 +/- 9 years). In a voxel-based comparison with 11 control subjects (men:women, 8:3; mean age, 37 +/- 9 years) using z score analysis, patient regions with abnormally reduced FA were defined in brain white matter. MR imaging, DTI, and fiber tracking characteristics of these regions were described and analyzed using Pearson correlation, linear regression analysis, or the chi(2) test when appropriate. RESULTS: Patients had on average 9.1 regions with reduced FA, with a mean region volume of 525 mm(3), predominantly found in cerebral lobar white matter, cingulum, and corpus callosum. These regions mainly involved supratentorial projection fiber bundles, callosal fibers, and fronto-temporo-occipital association fiber bundles. Internal capsules and infratentorial white matter were relatively infrequently affected. Of all of the involved fiber bundles, 19.3% showed discontinuity on fiber tracking. CONCLUSION: Patients with mild TBI have multiple regions with reduced FA in various white matter locations and involving various fiber bundles. A minority of these fiber bundles show discontinuity on fiber tracking.},

abstract = {Alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies (LBs) is phosphorylated at Ser129. We raised monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to this phosphorylation site (psyn) and examined 157 serial autopsy brains from a geriatric hospital. Anti-psyn immunoreactivity was observed in 40 of these cases (25.5%). Immunohistochemistry revealed 4 novel types of pathology: diffuse neuronal cytoplasmic staining (pre-LB); neuropil thread-like structures (Lewy threads); dot-like structures similar to argyrophilic grains (Lewy dots); and axons in the white matter (Lewy axons). This novel pathology was abundantly present around LBs and also involved the limbic subcortical white matter, the cerebral cortical molecular layer, and the spongiform changes of the medial temporal lobe associated with cases of dementia with LBs (DLB). The phosphorylated alpha-synuclein was limited to the temporal lobe in cases of Parkinson disease, spread from the temporal lobe to the frontal lobe in cases of DLB transitional form and further spread to the parietal and occipital lobes in DLB neocortical form. Our findings suggest that LB-related pathology initially involves the neuronal perikarya, dendrites, and axons, causes impairment of axonal transport and synaptic transmission, and later leads to the formation of LBs, a hallmark of functional disturbance long before neuronal cell death.},

abstract = {Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) contributes to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS). We used Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models of DS to show that the increased dose of the amyloid precursor protein gene, App, acts to markedly decrease NGF retrograde transport and cause degeneration of BFCNs. NGF transport was also decreased in mice expressing wild-type human APP or a familial AD-linked mutant APP; while significant, the decreases were less marked and there was no evident degeneration of BFCNs. Because of evidence suggesting that the NGF transport defect was intra-axonal, we explored within cholinergic axons the status of early endosomes (EEs). NGF-containing EEs were enlarged in Ts65Dn mice and their App content was increased. Our study thus provides evidence for a pathogenic mechanism for DS in which increased expression of App, in the context of trisomy, causes abnormal transport of NGF and cholinergic neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Aging is associated with microstructural changes in brain tissue that can be visualized using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). While previous studies have established age-related changes in white matter (WM) diffusion using DTI, the impact of age on gray matter (GM) diffusion remains unclear. The present study utilized DTI metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) to identify age differences in GM/WM microstructure in a sample of healthy older adults (N = 60). A secondary aim was to determine the functional significance of whole-brain GM/WM MD on global cognitive function using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Participants were divided into three age brackets (ages 50-59, 60-69, and 70+) to examine differences in MD and cognition by decade. MD was examined bilaterally in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes for the primary analyses and an aggregate measure of whole-brain MD was used to test relationships with cognition. Significantly higher MD was observed in bilateral GM of the temporal and parietal lobes, and in right hemisphere WM of the frontal and temporal lobes of older individuals. The most robust differences in MD were between the 50-59 and 70+ age groups. Higher whole-brain GM MD was associated with poorer RBANS performance in the 60-69 age group. Results suggest that aging has a significant and differential impact on GM/WM diffusion in healthy older adults, which may explain a modest degree of cognitive variability at specific time points during older adulthood.},

abstract = {This study examines the evolution of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology in a subcortical predilection site, the basal nucleus of Meynert (bnM), which is a major source of cortical cholinergic innervation. Brains of 51 autopsy cases were studied using silver techniques and immunostaining for tau-associated neurofibrillary pathology and for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) deposits. All cases are classified according to a procedure permitting differentiation of six stages of AD-related neurofibrillary changes in the cerebral cortex. Initial cytoskeletal abnormalities in the bnM are already noted in stage I of cortical neurofibrillary changes. The gradual development of the neurofibrillary pathology in the bnM parallels the progression of the AD-related stages in the cerebral cortex. A variety of morphologically distinguishable cytoskeletal alterations are observed in large nerve cells which predominate in the bnM. Based on these cellular alterations, a sequence of cytoskeletal deterioration is proposed. Initially, the abnormal tau protein is distributed diffusely throughout the cell body and the neuronal processes. Subsequently, it aggregates to form a neurofibrillary tangle, which appears as a spherical somatic inclusion. The cell processes gradually become fragmented. Finally the parent cell dies, leaving behind an extraneuronal "ghost tangle". With regard to the cortical stages of AD-related neurofibrillary changes, the initial forms of cytoskeletal changes in the bnM predominate in the transentorhinal AD stages (I and II), while "ghost tangles" preferentially occur in the neocortical stages (V and VI). The considerable morphological diversity of cytoskeletal alterations is typical of stages III and IV. These results indicate that individual neurons of the bnM enter the sequence of cytoskeletal deterioration at different times.},

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.},

The pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation of misfolded amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) proteins in the brain. Since AD etiology remains unclear, several hypotheses have emerged to elucidate its pathological pathways. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, a leading hypothesis for AD development, advocates A$\beta$ as the principal culprit. Additionally, evidence suggests that tau may contribute to AD pathology. A$\beta$ and tau have also been shown to impact each other's pathology either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, metal ion dyshomeostasis is associated with these misfolded proteins. Metal interactions with A$\beta$ and tau/ptau also influence their aggregation properties and neurotoxicity. Herein, we present current understanding on the roles of A$\beta$, tau, and metal ions, placing equal emphasis on each of these proposed features, as well as their inter-relationships in AD pathogenesis.},

Here, we discuss how a stressor-threshold model of how particular neurons and circuits are selectively vulnerable to disease may underly the etiology of familial and sporadic forms of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and ALS. According to this model, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of neuronal subpopulations to stressors and specific disease-related misfolding proteins determine neuronal morbidity. Neurodegenerative diseases then involve specific combinations of genetic predispositions and environmental stressors, triggering increasing age-related stress and proteostasis dysfunction in affected vulnerable neurons. Damage to vasculature, immune system, and local glial cells mediates environmental stress, which could drive disease at all stages.},

The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.},

In this study we compared the inter- and intra-observer agreements of this scale to the widely used rating scale of Fazekas. We confirmed the poor to reasonable intra- and inter-observer agreements of the Fazekas scale. The new scale, although more elaborate, provided good agreements with respect to the white matter, basal ganglia and infratentorial signal hyperintensities. In rating periventricular hyperintensities this scale yielded no advantage. It is concluded that this scale may be of use in studies especially focussing on deep white matter pathology on MRI, because it provides more detailed information, with good intra- and inter-observer reliability.},

abstract = {The estimation of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on a vector of quantitative biomarkers is of high interest to clinicians, patients, and biomedical researchers alike. In this work, quantile regression is employed to learn statistical models describing the evolution of such biomarkers. Two separate models are constructed using (1) subjects that progress from a cognitively normal (CN) stage to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and (2) subjects that progress from MCI to AD during the observation window of a longitudinal study. These models are then automatically combined to develop a multi-stage disease progression model for the whole disease course. A probabilistic approach is derived to estimate the current disease progress (DP) and the disease progression rate (DPR) of a given individual by fitting any acquired biomarkers to these models. A particular strength of this method is that it is applicable even if individual biomarker measurements are missing for the subject. Employing cognitive scores and image-based biomarkers, the presented method is used to estimate DP and DPR for subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Further, the potential use of these values as features for different classification tasks is demonstrated. For example, accuracy of 64% is reached for CN vs. MCI vs. AD classification.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, characterized by progressive loss of motor function. While the pathogenesis of ALS remains largely unknown, recent histological examinations of Brettschneider and colleagues have proposed four time-sequential stages of neuropathology in ALS based on levels of phosphorylated 43kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) aggregation. What governs dissemination of these aggregates between segregated regions of the brain is unknown. Here, we cross-reference stages of pTDP-43 pathology with in vivo diffusion weighted imaging data of 215 adult healthy control subjects, and reveal that regions involved in pTDP-43 pathology form a strongly interconnected component of the brain network (p=0.04) likely serving as an anatomical infrastructure facilitating pTDP-43 spread. Furthermore, brain regions of subsequent stages of neuropathology are shown to be more closely interconnected than regions of more distant stages (p=0.002). Computational simulation of disease spread from first-stage motor regions across the connections of the brain network reveals a pattern of pTDP-43 aggregation that reflects the stages of sequential involvement in neuropathology (p=0.02), a pattern in favor of the hypothesis of pTDP-43 pathology to spread across the brain along axonal pathways. Our findings thus provide computational evidence of disease spread in ALS to be directed and constrained by the topology of the anatomical brain network.},

METHODS: We searched the clinicaltrials.gov registry for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for AD of at least 18-month duration and extracted demographic, clinical, and trials characteristics, and change in main outcomes from the placebo groups. We obtained additional information from presentations, abstracts, publications, and sponsors. RESULTS: Of 23 trials identified, 11 were completed and had baseline data available; nine had follow-up data available; 17 were phase III. General inclusion criteria were very similar except that minimum Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores varied from 12 to 20. Sample sizes ranged from 402 to 1,684 for phase III trials and 80 to 400 for phase II. Cholinesterase inhibitor use was from 53% to 100%, and memantine use was from 13.5% to 78%. The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) was the co-primary outcome in all trials; and activities of daily living, global severity, or global change ratings were the other co-primaries. APOE epsilon4 genotype carriers ranged from 58% to 67%; mean baseline ADAS-cog was 17.8 to 24.2. ADAS-cog worsening in the placebo groups during 18 months ranged from 4.34 to 9.10, with standard deviations from 8.17 to 9.39, increasing during 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion criteria are essentially similar to earlier 6-month and 12-month trials in which cholinesterase inhibitors were not allowed, as were mean ADAS-cog rates of change. Yet increasing variability and relatively little change overall in the ADAS-cog placebo groups, eg, about 25% of patients do not worsen by more than 1 point, might make it more unlikely than previously assumed that a modestly effective drug can be reliably recognized, especially when the drug might work only to attenuate decline in function and not to improve function. These observations would be strengthened by pooling individual trials data, and pharmaceutical sponsors should participate in such efforts.},

abstract = {In highly polarized and elongated cells such as neurons, Tau protein must enter and move down the axon to fulfill its biological task of stabilizing axonal microtubules. Therefore, cellular systems for distributing Tau molecules are needed. This review discusses different mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to the dispersion of Tau molecules in neurons. They include (1) directed transport along microtubules as cargo of tubulin complexes and/or motor proteins, (2) diffusion, either through the cytosolic space or along microtubules, and (3) mRNA-based mechanisms such as transport of Tau mRNA into axons and local translation. Diffusion along the microtubule lattice or through the cytosol appear to be the major mechanisms for axonal distribution of Tau protein in the short-to-intermediate range over distances of up to a millimetre. The high diffusion coefficients ensure that Tau can distribute evenly throughout the axonal volume as well as along microtubules. Motor protein-dependent transport of Tau dominates over longer distances and time scales. At low near-physiological levels, Tau is co-transported along with short microtubules from cell bodies into axons by cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin family members at rates of slow axonal transport.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative dementing disorder which is characterised by a progressive atrophy of several brain regions. This process may be visualised in vivo by the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with appropriate volumetric post-processing techniques. Recent volumetric MRI studies in AD consistently found an extensive volume loss of the medial temporal lobe structures including amygdala and hippocampus which appeared already in the early clinical stages of the disorder. This finding is progressive during the clinical course of AD and is associated with other biological markers of the disease such as cerebrospinal fluid beta A 4 levels and apolipoprotein E genotype. With respect to the extent and the distribution of the structural changes, AD may be differentiated from other neuropsychiatric disorders which could facilitate the differential diagnosis in vivo.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify cognitively normal individuals at risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A$\beta$1-42, and to determine rates of cerebral atrophy. METHODS: Control subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with CSF and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were dichotomized on CSF A$\beta$1-42 (normal control [NC]-high > 192 pg/ml; NC-low ≤ 192 pg/ml). Baseline and 1-year MRIs were registered, and brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes and annualized volume changes were calculated. Baseline characteristics, CSF profiles, neuropsychology, brain volumes and atrophy rates, and APOE, PICALM, CLU, and TOMM40 genotypes were compared. Sample sizes to power presymptomatic clinical trials based on rate of atrophy were calculated. RESULTS: Forty of 105 (38%) were classified as NC-low, and 65 (62%) as NC-high. There were no differences in age (76.3 ± 5.1 vs 74.9 ± 5.1 years), gender, brain volumes, and all but 1 cognitive score (Trails B; p = 0.015). The NC-low group had higher tau (p = 0.005) and p-tau (p < 0.001), and was more likely to be APOE4 positive (48% vs 11%, p < 0.001). The NC-low group had significantly higher whole brain loss (9.3 vs 4.4 ml/yr, p < 0.001), ventricular expansion (2.04 vs 0.95 ml/yr, p = 0.002), and hippocampal atrophy rate (0.07 vs 0.03 ml/yr, p = 0.029). Baseline A$\beta$1-42 level was strongly correlated with rate of brain atrophy only in the NC-low group (p < 0.001). Using 141 (95% confidence interval, 86-287) patients per arm provides 80% power in a 1-year treatment trial to show 25% slowing of brain atrophy in the NC-low group. INTERPRETATION: A significant percentage of healthy older adults have CSF profiles consistent with AD and increased rates of brain atrophy, suggesting that they may be in the earliest stages of neurodegeneration. Brain atrophy may be a feasible outcome measure for AD prevention studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study reports the baseline characteristics of diffusion tensor imaging data in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy control subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. The main goals were to replicate previous findings of abnormal diffusion imaging values from the substantia nigra. in a large multicenter cohort and determine whether nigral diffusion alterations are associated with dopamine deficits. METHODS: Two hundred twenty subjects (PD = 153; control = 67) from 10 imaging sites were included. All subjects had a full neurological exam, a ((123) I)ioflupane dopamine transporter (DAT) single-photon emission computer tomography scan, and diffusion tensor imaging. Fractional anisotropy as well as radial and axial diffusivity was computed within multiple regions across the substantia nigra. RESULTS: A repeated-measures analysis of variance found a marginally nonsignificant interaction between regional fractional anisotropy of the substantia nigra and disease status (P = 0.08), conflicting with an earlier study. However, a linear mixed model that included control regions in addition to the nigral regions revealed a significant interaction between regions and disease status (P = 0.002), implying a characteristic distribution of reduced fractional anisotropy across the substantia nigra in PD. Reduced fractional anisotropy in PD was also associated with diminished DAT binding ratios. Both axial and radial diffusivity were also abnormal in PD. CONCLUSIONS: Although routine nigral measurements of fractional anisotropy are clinically not helpful, the findings in this study suggest that more-sophisticated diffusion imaging protocols should be used when exploring the clinical utility of this imaging modality. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

OBJECTIVE To determine if depression is associated with a subsequent risk for PD. METHODS A retrospective cohort study design based in general practice was applied. All subjects diagnosed with depression between 1975 and 1990 were included and matched with subjects with the same birth year who were never diagnosed with depression. Follow-up ended at April 30, 2000. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Subgroups based on sex and age at diagnosis of depression were evaluated separately. RESULTS Among the 1,358 depressed subjects, 19 developed PD, and among the 67,570 nondepressed subjects, 259 developed PD. The HR (95% CI) for depressed vs nondepressed subjects was 3.13 (1.95 to 5.01) in multivariable analysis. Associations in subgroups were comparable with the overall association.

abstract = {Following bilateral intraocular (i.o.) infection of Sinc s7 mice with ME7 scrapie, sequential tissue pools were taken from retina, optic nerve, superior colliculus (SC), dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), visual cortex and cerebellum. The infectivity levels in these pools were estimated by intracerebral (i.c.) assay in C57BL/FaBtDk mice. Infectivity was first detected in retina at 35 days post-injection (as an increase above residual injected inoculum), SC at 56 days, dLGN at 77 days and in optic nerve, visual cortex and cerebellum at 98 days. Pathological lesions were shown to develop in the same sequence later in the incubation period. Comparison of sequential retina and SC assays in congenic mice, which differ only in the vicinity of the Sinc locus, revealed a difference in the initial detection and progression of i.o. infection of between 60 and 100 days, indicating that Sinc acts by delaying the initiation of replication. Higher levels of infectivity were found in retina and SC of mice infected with 79A scrapie, which destroys the photoreceptor layer in the retina, than with ME7 scrapie, which does not. Retrograde transport of infection was indicated by the levels of infectivity in the retina after i.c. infection with ME7 or 79A scrapie. These results indicate that scrapie spread within the central nervous system is restricted to neuroanatomical pathways, and that Sinc controls the initiation, but not the rate of replication.},

Blending these disciplines may prove critical to our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases, which target specific anatomical systems. Recent research on frontotemporal dementia highlights the potential value of these approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia leads to progressive social-emotional processing deficits accompanied by anterior cingulate and frontal insular degeneration. These sites form a discrete human neural network and feature a class of layer 5b projection neurons, von Economo neurons, found only in large-brained, socially complex mammals. von Economo neurons have been shown to represent an early target in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia but not in Alzheimer's disease. SUMMARY: Integrative approaches to selective vulnerability may help clarify neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) disrupts our most human social and emotional functions. Early in the disease, patients show focal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbital frontoinsula (FI) degeneration, accentuated in the right hemisphere. The ACC and FI, though sometimes considered ancient in phylogeny, feature a large bipolar projection neuron, the von Economo neuron (VEN), which is found only in humans, apes, and selected whales-all large-brained mammals with complex social structures. In contrast to bvFTD, Alzheimer disease (AD) often spares social functioning, and the ACC and FI, until late in its course, damaging instead a posterior hippocampal-cingulo-temporal-parietal network involved in episodic memory retrieval. These divergent patterns of functional and regional impairment remain mysterious despite extensive molecular-level characterization of bvFTD and AD. In this report, we further develop the hypothesis that VENs drive the regional vulnerability pattern seen in bvFTD, citing recent evidence from functional imaging in healthy humans, and also structural imaging and quantitative neuropathology data from bvFTD and AD. Our most recent findings suggest that bvFTD and AD target distinct, anticorrelated intrinsic connectivity networks and that bvFTD-related VEN injury occurs throughout the ACC-FI network. We suggest that the regional and neuronal vulnerability patterns seen in bvFTD and AD underlie the divergent impact of these disorders on recently evolved social-emotional functions.},

abstract = {During development, the healthy human brain constructs a host of large-scale, distributed, function-critical neural networks. Neurodegenerative diseases have been thought to target these systems, but this hypothesis has not been systematically tested in living humans. We used network-sensitive neuroimaging methods to show that five different neurodegenerative syndromes cause circumscribed atrophy within five distinct, healthy, human intrinsic functional connectivity networks. We further discovered a direct link between intrinsic connectivity and gray matter structure. Across healthy individuals, nodes within each functional network exhibited tightly correlated gray matter volumes. The findings suggest that human neural networks can be defined by synchronous baseline activity, a unified corticotrophic fate, and selective vulnerability to neurodegenerative illness. Future studies may clarify how these complex systems are assembled during development and undermined by disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) strikes hardest at the frontal lobes, but the sites of earliest injury remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine atrophy patterns in distinct clinical stages of bvFTD, testing the hypothesis that the mildest stage is restricted to frontal paralimbic cortex. DESIGN: A bvFTD cohort study. SETTING: University hospital dementia clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with bvFTD with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale scores of 0.5 (n = 15), 1 (n = 15), or 2 to 3 (n = 15) age and sex matched to each other and to 45 healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance voxel-based morphometry estimated gray matter and white matter atrophy at each disease stage compared with controls. RESULTS: Patients with a CDR score of 0.5 had gray matter loss in frontal paralimbic cortices, but atrophy also involved a network of anterior cortical and subcortical regions. A CDR score of 1 showed more extensive frontal gray matter atrophy and white matter losses in corpus callosum and brainstem. A CDR score of 2 to 3 showed additional posterior insula, hippocampus, and parietal involvement, with white matter atrophy in presumed frontal projection fibers. CONCLUSIONS: Very mild bvFTD targets a specific subset of frontal and insular regions. More advanced disease affects white matter and posterior gray matter structures densely interconnected with the sites of earliest injury.},

abstract = {The hippocampal dentate gyrus is often viewed as a segregator of upstream information. Physiological support for such function has been hampered by a lack of well-defined characteristics that can identify granule cells and mossy cells. We developed an electrophysiology-based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell-mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely “inherited” place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation.},

Much is known about regional brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, yet our knowledge about the network nature of Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation is limited. We use stepwise connectivity analysis of Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography images to reveal the network properties of amyloid-$\beta$ deposits in normal elderly subjects and clinical patients with Alzheimer's disease. We found that amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation in the medial temporal lobe is associated with accumulation in cortical regions such as orbitofrontal, lateral temporal and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices in Alzheimer's disease. In normal subjects, there was a predominant association between amyloid-$\beta$ deposits in the hippocampus and the midline prefrontal/orbitofrontal regions, even in those with very low amyloid-$\beta$ burden. Moreover, the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala nucleus and hippocampus exhibit hub properties in the amyloid-$\beta$ network that may be critical to understanding the putative spreading mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathology in early stages.},

We used a high-resolution graph-based approach to investigate local-tolocal and local-to-distributed cortical associations between the maps of Tau, amyloid-$\beta$, and gray matter intensity. Our study shows that Tau and amyloid-$\beta$ deposits are associated with distinctive spatial patterns of brain tissue loss. Moreover, Tau and amyloid-$\beta$ accumulations have strong network interdigitations in heteromodal and associative areas of the cortical mantle, particularly the inferior–lateral temporal lobe. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of how these two main hallmarks of AD pathology propagate across the elderly human brain.},

Despite their inherently cross-sectional nature, postmortem studies have enabled the staging of the progression of both amyloid and tangle pathologies, and, consequently, the development of diagnostic criteria that are now used worldwide. In addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by establishing that there is a continuum between "normal" aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid plaque build-up occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while neurofibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the progression of cognitive decline. Importantly, these cross-sectional neuropathological data have been largely validated by longitudinal in vivo studies using modern imaging biomarkers such as amyloid PET and volumetric MRI.},

Important molecular interactions leading to AD neuropathology were described in amyloid cascade and in tau protein function. No clinical trials with novel therapies based on amyloid cascade and tau protein hypotheses have been successful. The main aim of recent research is focused on the question what is primary mechanism leading to the molecular development of AD pathology. Promising explanation of triggering mechanism can be seen in vascular pathology that have direct influence on the development of pathological processes typical for Alzheimer disease.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified CLU, PICALM, and CR1 as novel genes for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To identify and strengthen additional loci associated with AD and confirm these in an independent sample and to examine the contribution of recently identified genes to AD risk prediction in a 3-stage analysis of new and previously published GWAS on more than 35,000 persons (8371 AD cases). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In stage 1, we identified strong genetic associations (P < 10(-3)) in a sample of 3006 AD cases and 14,642 controls by combining new data from the population-based Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium (1367 AD cases [973 incident]) with previously reported results from the Translational Genomics Research Institute and the Mayo AD GWAS. We identified 2708 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 10(-3). In stage 2, we pooled results for these SNPs with the European AD Initiative (2032 cases and 5328 controls) to identify 38 SNPs (10 loci) with P < 10(-5). In stage 3, we combined data for these 10 loci with data from the Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD consortium (3333 cases and 6995 controls) to identify 4 SNPs with P < 1.7x10(-8). These 4 SNPs were replicated in an independent Spanish sample (1140 AD cases and 1209 controls). Genome-wide association analyses were completed in 2007-2008 and the meta-analyses and replication in 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: Two loci were identified to have genome-wide significance for the first time: rs744373 near BIN1 (odds ratio [OR],1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.06-1.21 per copy of the minor allele; P = 1.59x10(-11)) and rs597668 near EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; P = 6.45x10(-9)). Associations of these 2 loci plus the previously identified loci CLU and PICALM with AD were confirmed in the Spanish sample (P < .05). However, although CLU and PICALM were confirmed to be associated with AD in this independent sample, they did not improve the ability of a model that included age, sex, and APOE to predict incident AD (improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.847 to 0.849 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.702 to 0.705 in the Cardiovascular Health Study). CONCLUSIONS: Two genetic loci for AD were found for the first time to reach genome-wide statistical significance. These findings were replicated in an independent population. Two recently reported associations were also confirmed. These loci did not improve AD risk prediction. While not clinically useful, they may implicate biological pathways useful for future research.},

This should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed clusters. The congruence between classifications can be quantified by clustering agreement measures, including pairwise agreement measures. Several measures have been proposed and the importance of obtaining confidence intervals for the point estimate in the comparison of these measures has been highlighted. A broad range of methods can be used for the estimation of confidence intervals. However, evidence is lacking about what are the appropriate methods for the calculation of confidence intervals for most clustering agreement measures. Here we evaluate the resampling techniques of bootstrap and jackknife for the calculation of the confidence intervals for clustering agreement measures. Contrary to what has been shown for some statistics, simulations showed that the jackknife performs better than the bootstrap at accurately estimating confidence intervals for pairwise agreement measures, especially when the agreement between partitions is low. The coverage of the jackknife confidence interval is robust to changes in cluster number and cluster size distribution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The accumulation of data and its accessibility through easier-to-use platforms will allow data scientists and practitioners who are less sophisticated data analysts to get answers by using big data for many purposes in multiple ways. Data scientists working with medical data are aware of the importance of preprocessing, yet in many cases, the potential benefits of using nonlinear transformations is overlooked. OBJECTIVE Our aim is to present a semi-automated approach of symmetry-aiming transformations tailored for medical data analysis and its advantages. METHODS We describe 10 commonly encountered data types used in the medical field and the relevant transformations for each data type. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, Parkinson's disease hospital cohort, and disease-simulating data were used to demonstrate the approach and its benefits. RESULTS Symmetry-targeted monotone transformations were applied, and the advantages gained in variance, stability, linearity, and clustering are demonstrated. An open source application implementing the described methods was developed. Both linearity of relationships and increase of stability of variability improved after applying proper nonlinear transformation. Clustering simulated nonsymmetric data gave low agreement to the generating clusters (Rand value=0.681), while capturing the original structure after applying nonlinear transformation to symmetry (Rand value=0.986). CONCLUSIONS This work presents the use of nonlinear transformations for medical data and the importance of their semi-automated choice. Using the described approach, the data analyst increases the ability to create simpler, more robust and translational models, thereby facilitating the interpretation and implementation of the analysis by medical practitioners. Applying nonlinear transformations as part of the preprocessing is essential to the quality and interpretability of results.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease constitutes a rising threat to public health. Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying the pathogenic agent present in the human brain and showing that it confers key features of Alzheimer's disease has not been achieved. We extracted soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The oligomers potently inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), enhanced long-term depression (LTD) and reduced dendritic spine density in normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats. These various effects were specifically attributable to Abeta dimers. Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors were required for the LTD enhancement, and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors were required for the spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the Abeta N-terminus prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the midregion or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores from Alzheimer's disease cortex did not impair LTP unless they were first solubilized to release Abeta dimers, suggesting that plaque cores are largely inactive but sequester Abeta dimers that are synaptotoxic. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers extracted from Alzheimer's disease brains potently impair synapse structure and function and that dimers are the smallest synaptotoxic species.},

abstract = {Reduced dopamine input to cortical and subcortical brain structures, particularly those in the sensorimotor network, is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The extent to which dopamine dysfunction affects connectivity within this and other brain networks remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to measure anatomical and functional connectivity in groups of PD patients and controls to determine whether connectivity deficits within the cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical system could be attributed to PD, particularly in sensorimotor connections. A neuroimaging paradigm involving diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI was implemented in a large cohort of PD patients and control subjects. Probabilistic tractography and functional correlation analyses were performed to map connections between brain structures and to derive indices of connectivity that were then used to compare groups. Anatomical connectivity deficits were demonstrated in PD patients, specifically for sensorimotor connections. Functional deficits were also found in some of the same connections. In addition, functional connectivity was found to increase in associative and limbic connections in PD patients compared with controls. This study lends support to findings regarding the dysfunction of the sensorimotor circuit in PD. As deficits in anatomical and functional connectivity within this circuit were in some cases concordant in PD patients, a possible link between brain structure and function is suggested. Increases in functional connectivity in other cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits may be indicative of compensatory effects in response to system deficits elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract = {The close correlation between abnormally low pre-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid-$\beta$1-42 (A$\beta$(1-42)) and plaque burden measured by amyloid imaging as well as between pathologically increased levels of CSF tau and the extent of neurodegeneration measured by MRI has led to growing interest in using these biomarkers to predict the presence of AD plaque and tangle pathology. A challenge for the widespread use of these CSF biomarkers is the high variability in the assays used to measure these analytes which has been ascribed to multiple pre-analytical and analytical test performance factors. To address this challenge, we conducted a seven-center inter-laboratory standardization study for CSF total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (p-tau(181)) and A$\beta$(1-42) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Aliquots prepared from five CSF pools assembled from multiple elderly controls (n = 3) and AD patients (n = 2) were the primary test samples analyzed in each of three analytical runs by the participating laboratories using a common batch of research use only immunoassay reagents (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, xMAP technology, from Innogenetics) on the Luminex analytical platform. To account for the combined effects on overall precision of CSF samples (fixed effect), different laboratories and analytical runs (random effects), these data were analyzed by mixed-effects modeling with the following results: within center %CV 95% CI values (mean) of 4.0-6.0% (5.3%) for CSF A$\beta$(1-42); 6.4-6.8% (6.7%) for t-tau and 5.5-18.0% (10.8%) for p-tau(181) and inter-center %CV 95% CI range of 15.9-19.8% (17.9%) for A$\beta$(1-42), 9.6-15.2% (13.1%) for t-tau and 11.3-18.2% (14.6%) for p-tau(181). Long-term experience by the ADNI biomarker core laboratory replicated this degree of within-center precision. Diagnostic threshold CSF concentrations for A$\beta$(1-42) and for the ratio t-tau/A$\beta$(1-42) were determined in an ADNI independent, autopsy-confirmed AD cohort from whom ante-mortem CSF was obtained, and a clinically defined group of cognitively normal controls (NCs) provides statistically significant separation of those who progressed from MCI to AD in the ADNI study. These data suggest that interrogation of ante-mortem CSF in cognitively impaired individuals to determine levels of t-tau, p-tau(181) and A$\beta$(1-42), together with MRI and amyloid imaging biomarkers, could replace autopsy confirmation of AD plaque and tangle pathology as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of definite AD in the near future.},

abstract = {Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia in the elderly. Pathologically, AD is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble aggregates of A$\beta$-peptides that are proteolytic cleavage products of the amyloid-$\beta$ precursor protein ("plaques") and by insoluble filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein ("tangles"). Familial forms of AD often display increased production of A$\beta$ peptides and/or altered activity of presenilins, the catalytic subunits of $\gamma$-secretase that produce A$\beta$ peptides. Although the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, recent studies have highlighted two major themes that are likely important. First, oligomeric A$\beta$ species have strong detrimental effects on synapse function and structure, particularly on the postsynaptic side. Second, decreased presenilin function impairs synaptic transmission and promotes neurodegeneration. The mechanisms underlying these processes are beginning to be elucidated, and, although their relevance to AD remains debated, understanding these processes will likely allow new therapeutic avenues to AD.},

abstract = {Despite the demonstration that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) can trigger increased tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in vivo, the molecular link associating A$\beta$ and tau pathologies remains ill defined. Here, we observed that exposure of cultured primary neurons to A$\beta$ trimers isolated from brain tissue of subjects with Alzheimer's disease led to a specific conformational change of tau detected by the antibody Alz50. A similar association was supported by postmortem human brain analyses. To study the role of A$\beta$ trimers in vivo, we created a novel bigenic Tg-A$\beta$+Tau mouse line by crossing Tg2576 (Tg-A$\beta$) and rTg4510 (Tg-Tau) mice. Before neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, apparent A$\beta$ trimers were increased by $\sim$2-fold in 3-month-old Tg-A$\beta$ and Tg-A$\beta$+Tau mice compared with younger mice, whereas soluble monomeric A$\beta$ levels were unchanged. Under these conditions, the expression of soluble Alz50-tau conformers rose by $\sim$2.2-fold in the forebrains of Tg-A$\beta$+Tau mice compared with nontransgenic littermates. In parallel, APP accumulated intracellularly, suggestive of a putative dysfunction of anterograde axonal transport. We found that the protein abundance of the kinesin-1 light chain (KLC1) was reduced selectively in vivo and in vitro when soluble A$\beta$ trimers/Alz50-tau were present. Importantly, the reduction in KLC1 was prevented by the intraneuronal delivery of Alz50 antibodies. Collectively, our findings reveal that specific soluble conformers of A$\beta$ and tau cooperatively disrupt axonal transport independently from plaques and tangles. Finally, these results suggest that not all endogenous A$\beta$ oligomers trigger the same deleterious changes and that the role of each assembly should be considered separately.},

abstract = {The thalamus has long been seen as responsible for relaying information on the way to the cerebral cortex, but it has not been until the last decade or so that the functional nature of this relay has attracted significant attention. Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

We used the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify 196 subjects who developed PD in Olmsted County, Minnesota, during the years 1976-1995. Each case was matched by age (+/-1 yr) and sex to a general population control. We reviewed the complete medical records of cases and control subjects to detect preceding psychiatric disorders. The frequency of psychiatric disorders was higher in cases than in control subjects; the odds ratio was 2.2 for anxiety disorders (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.4-3.4; p = 0.0003), 1.9 for depressive disorders (95% CI = 1.1-3.2; p = 0.02), and 2.4 for both anxiety disorders and depressive disorders occurring in the same individual (95% CI = 1.2-4.8; p = 0.02). When we restricted analyses to disorders present 5 years or more before the onset of motor symptoms of PD, the association with depressive disorders lost statistical significance. However, the association with anxiety disorders remained significant for disorders present 5, 10, or 20 years before onset of motor symptoms. Our results suggest that anxiety disorders and depressive disorders are associated with PD and that the causative process or the risk factors underlying PD are present many years before the appearance of motor symptoms.},

However direct in vivo evidence regarding initial Abeta seeding is missing. Using an APP transgenic mouse model, our sensitive immunocytochemical procedures revealed a novel intraneuronal Abeta deposition in the somas of hippocampal CA1/subiculum neurons far in advance of the occurrence of extracellular Abetaplaques. These deposits increased exponentially with age and were elevated approximately 4-fold (p < 0.001) by high fat/high cholesterol diet. Abeta40 and Abeta42 were the major constituents of these deposits and were co-localized with lysosomal markers. Our results are consistent with the notion that the earliest Abeta deposition occurs intraneuronally, prior to extracellular amyloid plaque formation.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE While numerous genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for clinical Alzheimer disease (AD), it is important to establish whether these variants are risk factors for the underlying disease pathology, including neuritic plaques. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether AD susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies affect neuritic plaque pathology and to additionally identify novel risk loci for this trait. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Candidate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide association study in a joint clinicopathologic cohort, including 725 deceased subjects from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (2 prospective, community-based studies), followed by targeted validation in an independent neuroimaging cohort, including 114 subjects from multiple clinical and research centers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A quantitative measure of neuritic plaque pathologic burden, based on assessments of silver-stained tissue averaged from multiple brain regions. Validation based on $\beta$-amyloid load by immunocytochemistry, and replication with fibrillar $\beta$-amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B or florbetapir. RESULTS Besides the previously reported APOE and CR1 loci, we found that the ABCA7 (rs3764650; P = .02) and CD2AP (rs9349407; P = .03) AD susceptibility loci are associated with neuritic plaque burden. In addition, among the top results of our genome-wide association study, we discovered a novel variant near the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP, rs2829887) that is associated with neuritic plaques (P = 3.3 × 10-6). This polymorphism was associated with postmortem $\beta$-amyloid load as well as fibrillar $\beta$-amyloid in 2 independent cohorts of adults with normal cognition. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings enhance understanding of AD risk factors by relating validated susceptibility alleles to increased neuritic plaque pathology and implicate common genetic variation at the APP locus in the earliest, presymptomatic stages of AD.},

The comorbidity of these nonmotor symptoms and their relationship to PD severity has not been extensively evaluated. Ninety- nine nondemented PD patients were evaluated with the following battery of tests: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a sensory symptom questionnaire, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn & Yahr (H/Y) Stage, and the Schwab & England ADL scale (S/E). The comorbidity of the nonmotor symptoms and their relationship to PD severity was analyzed. Thirty-six percent of the study population had depression (BDI > or =10), 33% had anxiety (BAI > or =10), 40% had fatigue (FSS > 4), 47% had sleep disturbance (PSQI > 5), and 63% reported sensory symptoms. Only 12% of the sample had no nonmotor symptoms. Fifty-nine percent of the patients had two or more nonmotor symptoms, and nearly 25% had four or more. Increased comorbidity was associated with greater PD severity (P < 001). This study reveals that the nonmotor symptoms of PD frequently occur together in the same patients. Increased comorbidity of the five nonmotor symptoms was associated with greater PD severity. These results suggest that recognition of these diverse nonmotor symptoms may be enhanced by looking for others when one nonmotor symptom has been identified.},

Currently, popular maximum likelihood based parallel imaging reconstruction techniques such as the SENSE algorithm offer this advantage at the cost of reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction techniques that incorporate globally smooth priors have been developed to recover this SNR loss, but they tend to blur sharp edges in the target image. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of employing edge-preserving Markov random field priors in a MAP reconstruction framework, which can be solved efficiently using a graph cuts based optimization algorithm. The preliminary human study shows that our reconstruction provides significantly better SNR than the SENSE reconstruction performed by a commercially available scanner for navigator gated steady state free precession 3D coronary magnetic resonance angiography images (n = 4).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of MRI based methods could prove extremely valuable for identification of reliable biomarkers to aid diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). A great deal of current research has been aimed at identification biomarkers for both diagnosis at early stage and evaluation of the progression of NDs. NEW METHOD: We present here a novel synergetic paradigm integrating Kohonen self organizing map (KSOM) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for individual-level clinical diagnosis of NDs. Feature are extracted in an unsupervised manner using KSOM on preprocessed brain MRIs. Thereafter, these features are fed as input to LSSVM for subject classification. RESULTS: The applicability of the proposed methodology has been demonstrated using 831 T1-weighted MRIs obtained from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. We have achieved classification accuracy of up to 99% for differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease with confidence interval of 99.9%. COMPARISON WITH OTHER EXISTING METHODS: The potential for translation of similar research findings to clinical application is greatly dependent upon two factors (1) accuracy of subject classification achieved and (2) size of the dataset used. Here, we report very high accuracy achieved on one of the largest MRI datasets using multivariate analysis tools. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we describe a methodology that has the potential to be translated into first-line diagnostic tool for NDs. We also demonstrate the applicability of this methodology for diagnosing PD subjects in early stages of the disease, i.e., subjects in age of 31-60 years.},

abstract = {Whereas amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) accumulates in the brain of normal animals dosed with low levels of copper (Cu), the mechanism is not completely known. Cu could contribute to A$\beta$ accumulation by altering its clearance and/or its production. Because Cu homeostasis is altered in transgenic mice overexpressing A$\beta$ precursor protein (APP), the objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of Cu-induced A$\beta$ accumulation in brains of normal mice and then to explore Cu's effects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In aging mice, accumulation of Cu in brain capillaries was associated with its reduction in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), an A$\beta$ transporter, and higher brain A$\beta$ levels. These effects were reproduced by chronic dosing with low levels of Cu via drinking water without changes in A$\beta$ synthesis or degradation. In human brain endothelial cells, Cu, at its normal labile levels, caused LRP1-specific down-regulation by inducing its nitrotyrosination and subsequent proteosomal-dependent degradation due in part to Cu/cellular prion protein/LRP1 interaction. In APP(sw/0) mice, Cu not only down-regulated LRP1 in brain capillaries but also increased A$\beta$ production and neuroinflammation because Cu accumulated in brain capillaries and, unlike in control mice, in the parenchyma. Thus, we have demonstrated that Cu's effect on brain A$\beta$ homeostasis depends on whether it is accumulated in the capillaries or in the parenchyma. These findings should provide unique insights into preventative and/or therapeutic approaches to control neurotoxic A$\beta$ levels in the aging brain.},

abstract = {Goal-directed sensorimotor transformation drives important aspects of mammalian behavior. The striatum is thought to play a key role in reward-based learning and action selection, receiving glutamatergic sensorimotor signals and dopaminergic reward signals. Here, we obtain whole-cell membrane potential recordings from the dorsolateral striatum of mice trained to lick a reward spout after a whisker deflection. Striatal projection neurons showed strong task-related modulation, with more depolarization and action potential firing on hit trials compared to misses. Direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, exhibited a prominent early sensory response. Optogenetic stimulation of direct pathway striatonigral neurons, but not indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, readily substituted for whisker stimulation evoking a licking response. Our data are consistent with direct pathway striatonigral neurons contributing a "go" signal for goal-directed sensorimotor transformation leading to action initiation. Video Abstract: Sippy et al. measure cell-type-specific membrane potential dynamics in the striatum of head-restrained mice performing a simple goal-directed sensorimotor transformation. Their results are consistent with direct pathway striatonigral neurons delivering a fast "go" signal for action initiation.},

@article{Skaper2012,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the largest unmet medical need in neurology today. This most common form of irreversible dementia is placing a considerable and increasing burden on patients, caregivers, and society, as more people live long enough to become affected. Current drugs improve symptoms but do not have profound neuroprotective and/or disease-modifying effects. AD is characterized by loss of neurons, dystrophic neurites, senile/amyloid/neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic loss. Beta-amyloid (A$\beta$) peptide deposition is the major pathological feature of AD. Increasing evidence suggests that overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein and subsequent generation of the 39-43 amino acid residue, A$\beta$, are central to neuronal degeneration observed in AD patients possessing familial AD mutations, while transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein develop AD-like pathology. Despite the genetic and cell biological evidence that supports the amyloid hypothesis, it is becoming increasing clear that AD etiology is complex and that A$\beta$ alone is unable to account for all aspects of AD. The fact that vast overproduction of A$\beta$ peptides in the brain of transgenic mouse models fails to cause overt neurodegeneration raises the question as to whether accumulation of A$\beta$ peptides is indeed the culprit for neurodegeneration in AD. There is increasing evidence to suggest that A$\beta$/amyloid-independent factors, including the actions of AD-related genes (microtubule-associated protein tau, polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E4), inflammation, and oxidative stress, also contribute to AD pathogenesis. This chapter reviews the current state of knowledge on these factors and their possible interactions, as well as their potential for neuroprotection targets.},

abstract = {With few exceptions, the marked advances in knowledge about the genetic basis of schizophrenia have not converged on findings that can be confidently used for precise experimental modeling. By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding mRNAs that interact with FMRP, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Increased white matter mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) has been observed in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine whether similar alterations of white matter occur in normal individuals at risk of AD. Diffusion tensor images were acquired in 42 cognitively normal right-handed women with both a family history of dementia and at least one apolipoprotein E4 allele. These were compared with images from 23 normal women without either AD risk factor. Group analyses were performed using tract-based spatial statistics. Reduced FA was observed in the fronto-occipital and inferior temporal fasciculi (particularly posteriorly), the splenium of the corpus callosum, subcallosal white matter and the cingulum bundle. These findings demonstrate that specific white matter pathways are altered in normal women at increased risk of AD years before the expected onset of cognitive symptoms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE[---]To test predictions that frontotemporal dementia and semantic dementia give rise to distinct patterns of behavioural change. METHODS[---]An informant based semistructured behavioural interview, covering the domains of basic and social emotions, social and personal behaviour, sensory behaviour, eating and oral behaviour, repetitive behaviours, rituals, and compulsions, was administered to carers of 41 patients with semantic dementia and with apathetic (FTD-A) and disinhibited (FTD-D) forms of frontotemporal dementia. RESULTS[---]Consistent with prediction, emotional changes differentiated FTD from semantic dementia. Whereas lack of emotional response was pervasive in FTD, it was more selective in semantic dementia, affecting particularly the capacity to show fear. Social avoidance occurred more often in FTD and social seeking in semantic dementia. Patients with FTD showed reduced response to pain, whereas patients with semantic dementia more often showed exaggerated reactions to sensory stimuli. Gluttony and indiscriminate eating were characteristic of FTD, whereas patients with semantic dementia were more likely to exhibit food fads. Hyperorality, involving inedible objects, was unrelated to gluttony, indicating different underlying mechanisms. Repetitive behaviours were common in both FTD and semantic dementia, but had a more compulsive quality in semantic dementia. Behavioural differences were greater between semantic dementia and FTD-A than FTD-D. A logistic regression analysis indicated that emotional and repetitive, compulsive behaviours discriminated FTD from semantic dementia with 97% accuracy. CONCLUSION[---]The findings confirm predictions regarding behavioural differences in frontotemporal and semantic dementia and point to differential roles of the frontal and temporal lobes in affect, social functioning, eating, and compulsive behaviour.},

Yet, now that many other brain regions have been explored and neurophysiologists are turning to questions of how larger circuits operate, these two characteristics are starting to seem more attractive. First, the relay nature of thalamic neurons means that recording from them, like tapping into a wire, can reveal the signals carried by specific circuits. Second, the concentration of like relay neurons into nuclei means that inactivating or stimulating them can efficiently test the functions of the circuits. Recent studies implementing these principles have revealed pathways through the thalamus that contribute to generating movements and to monitoring one's own actions (corollary discharge).},

Predicting rapid cognitive decline might help clinicians provide prognostic information, select subjects for trial intervention and/or reduce costs. METHODS: PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for all the English written studies published until the end of 2010 on rapid cognitive decline in AD and factors associated with it. RESULTS: More than 300 individual articles were retrieved. We selected 82 relevant studies. The main findings of these papers are that younger, more educated and more impaired patients are more likely to show rapid cognitive decline. ApoE alleles seem not to modify the velocity of clinical progression of dementia, or at most could have a very small effect. No inference can be made for all the other variables analysed. CONCLUSIONS: There are many studies on rapid cognitive decline. Results are heterogeneous and often contradictory. No reliable conclusions about factors that may be associated with rapid cognitive decline can yet be drawn.},

Preclinical evidence suggests that tau spread depends on neuronal connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. Here, we present a novel physics-informed geometric learning model for predicting tau buildup and spread that learns patterns directly from longitudinal tau imaging data while receiving guidance from governing physical principles. Implemented as a graph neural network with physics-based regularization in latent space, the model enables effective training with smaller data sizes. For training and validation of the model, we used longitudinal tau measures from positron emission tomography (PET) and structural connectivity graphs from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. The model led to higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower mean squared error levels than both an unregularized graph neural network and a differential equation solver. The method was validated using both two-timepoint and three-timepoint tau PET measures. The effectiveness of the approach was further confirmed by a cross-validation study.},

abstract = {Recent research has revealed general principles in the structural and functional organization of complex networks which are shared by various natural, social and technological systems. This review examines these principles as applied to the organization, development and function of complex brain networks. Specifically, we examine the structural properties of large-scale anatomical and functional brain networks and discuss how they might arise in the course of network growth and rewiring. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the structural substrate of neuroanatomy and more dynamic functional and effective connectivity patterns that underlie human cognition. We suggest that network analysis offers new fundamental insights into global and integrative aspects of brain function, including the origin of flexible and coherent cognitive states within the neural architecture.},

We attempt to characterize a wide variety of cortical connectivity data sets using a specific set of graph theory methods. We measure global aspects of cortical graphs including the abundance of small structural motifs such as cycles, the degree of local clustering of connections and the average path length. We examine large-scale cortical connection matrices obtained from neuroanatomical data bases, as well as probabilistic connection matrices at the level of small cortical neuronal populations linked by intra-areal and inter-areal connections. All cortical connection matrices examined in this study exhibit "small-world" attributes, characterized by the presence of abundant clustering of connections combined with short average distances between neuronal elements. We discuss the significance of these universal organizational features of cortex in light of functional brain anatomy. Supplementary materials are at www.indiana.edu/$\sim$cortex/lab.htm.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively determine regional differences in fiber tract integrity between elderly patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy elderly subjects by using diffusion-tensor imaging with parallel imaging techniques and a new eight-element receiving coil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Fifteen patients with AD (seven men, eight women; mean age; 68.8 years), 16 patients with MCI (nine men, seven women; mean age, 68.9 years) and 19 healthy control subjects (eight men, 11 women; mean age, 63.9 years) underwent diffusion-tensor imaging performed with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance system. An echo-planar imaging diffusion sequence was used with an integrated parallel acquisition technique (PAT) and an eight-element head coil. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), and relative anisotropy (RA) values of several white matter (WM) regions were determined. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used initially to test for overall equality of median values in each data group. Single posttest comparisons were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test, with an overall statistical significance level of .05. RESULTS: FA and RA values were significantly (P < .05) decreased, whereas ADC values in the splenium of the corpus callosum were higher in patients with AD than in patients with MCI. Evidence of higher ADC values in the WM of the temporal lobe was observed in patients with AD compared with the ADC values in patients with MCI and in control subjects. ADC values in the parietal WM were significantly (P < .05) elevated in patients with MCI compared with those in control subjects. The images obtained with integrated PAT showed fewer susceptibility artifacts and were less distorted than images acquired without parallel imaging techniques. CONCLUSION: Reduced FA and RA values in patients with AD suggest that diffusion-tensor imaging of the brain can be used to confirm clinical manifestation of AD but is less applicable in the detection of MCI.},

abstract = {Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; gray matter structures in the medial temporal lobe. Few studies have investigated the integrity of white matter in patients with AD or MCI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a MRI technique that allows for the interrogation of the microstructural integrity of white matter. Based on increases in translational diffusion (mean diffusivity: MD) and decreases directional diffusion (fractional anisotropy: FA) damage to white matter can be assessed. Studies have identified regions of increased MD and decreased FA in patients with AD and MCI in all lobes of the brain, as well as medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal white matter. The pattern of white matter integrity disruption tends to follow an anterior to posterior gradient with greater damage noted in posterior regions in AD and MCI. Recent studies have exploited inter-voxel directional similarities to develop models of white matter pathways, and have used these models to assess the integrity of inter-cerebral connections. Particular focus has been applied to the parahippocampal white matter (including the perforant path) and the posterior cingulum. Although many studies have found DTI indicators of impaired white matter in AD and MCI, other studies have failed to detect any differences in MD or FA between the groups, demonstrating the need for large replicative studies. DTI is an evolving technique and advances in its application ought to provide new insights into AD and MCI.},

Furthermore, secreted $\alpha$-synuclein may exert deleterious effects on neighboring cells, including seeding of aggregation, thus possibly contributing to disease propagation. Although the extent to which $\alpha$-synuclein is involved in all cases of PD is not clear, targeting the toxic functions conferred by this protein when it is dysregulated may lead to novel therapeutic strategies not only in PD, but also in other neurodegenerative conditions, termed synucleinopathies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, all rights reserved.},

The molecular mechanisms by which substantia nigra dopamine neurons die and whether the Lewy pathology is directly involved in the cell death pathway are open questions. More recently, it has become apparent that Lewy pathology gradually involves greater parts of the PD brain and is widespread in late stages. In this review, we first discuss the role of misfolded $\alpha$-synuclein protein, which is the main constituent of Lewy bodies, in the pathogenesis of PD. We then describe recent evidence that $\alpha$-synuclein might transfer between cells in PD brains. We discuss in detail the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the proposed propagation and the likely consequences for cells that take up $\alpha$-synuclein. Finally, we focus on aspects of the pathogenic process that could be targeted with new pharmaceutical therapies or used to develop biomarkers for early PD detection.},

abstract = {An unexpected role for the classical complement cascade in the elimination of central nervous system (CNS) synapses has recently been discovered. Complement proteins are localized to developing CNS synapses during periods of active synapse elimination and are required for normal brain wiring. The function of complement proteins in the brain appears analogous to their function in the immune system: clearance of cellular material that has been tagged for elimination. Similarly, synapses tagged with complement proteins may be eliminated by microglial cells expressing complement receptors. In addition, developing astrocytes release signals that induce the expression of complement components in the CNS. In the mature brain, early synapse loss is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Complement proteins are profoundly upregulated in many CNS diseases prior to signs of neuron loss, suggesting a reactivation of similar developmental mechanisms of complement-mediated synapse elimination potentially driving disease progression.},

abstract = {Microtubule-based axonal transport is tightly regulated by numerous pathways, ensuring appropriate delivery of specific organelle cargoes to selected subcellular domains. Highlighting the importance of this process, pathological evidence has linked alterations in these pathways to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. An important regulator of this system, the microtubule-associated protein Tau, has been shown to participate in signaling cascades, modulate microtubule dynamics, and preferentially inhibit kinesin-1 motility. However, the cellular means of regulating Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility remains unknown. Tau is subject to various posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, but whether phosphorylation regulates Tau on the microtubule surface has not been addressed. It has been shown that tyrosine 18 phosphorylated Tau regulates inhibition of axonal transport in the disease state. Tyrosine 18 is both a disease- and nondisease-state modification and is therefore an attractive starting point for understanding control of Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility. We show that pseudophosphorylation of tyrosine 18 reduces 3RS-Tau's inhibition of kinesin-1 motility. In addition, we show that introduction of negative charge at tyrosine 18 shifts Tau's previously described static–dynamic state binding equilibrium toward the dynamic state. We also present the first evidence of Tau's static–dynamic state equilibrium under physiological conditions.},

abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein tau, abundant in neurons, has gained notoriety due to the fact that it is deposited in cells as fibrillar lesions in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, and most notably Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of microtubule dynamics is the most well-recognized function of tau, but it is becoming increasingly evident that tau plays additional roles in the cell. The functions of tau are regulated by site-specific phosphorylation events, which if dysregulated, as they are in the disease state, result in tau dysfunction and mislocalization, which is potentially followed by tau polymerization, neuronal dysfunction and death. Given the increasing evidence that a disruption in the normal phosphorylation state of tau plays a key role in the pathogenic events that occur in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, it is of crucial importance that the protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate tau phosphorylation in vivo as well as the signaling cascades that regulate them be identified. This review focuses on recent literature pertaining to the regulation of tau phosphorylation and function in cell culture and animal model systems, and the role that a dysregulation of tau phosphorylation may play in the neuronal dysfunction and death that occur in neurodegenerative diseases that have tau pathology.},

abstract = {The retrogenesis model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits that white matter (WM) degeneration follows a pattern that is the reverse of myelogenesis. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to test this model, we predicted greater loss of microstructural integrity in late-myelinating WM fiber pathways in AD patients than in healthy older adults, whereas differences in early-myelinating WM fiber pathways were not expected. We compared 16 AD patients and 14 demographically-matched healthy older adults with a whole-brain approach via tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and a region of interest (ROI) approach targeting early-myelinating (posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebral peduncles) and late-myelinating (inferior longitudinal fasciculus [ILF], superior longitudinal fasciculus [SLF]) fiber pathways. Permutation-based voxelwise analysis supported the retrogenesis model. There was significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in AD patients compared to healthy older adults in late-myelinating but not early-myelinating pathways. These group differences appeared to be driven by loss of myelin integrity based on our finding of greater radial diffusion in AD than in healthy elderly. ROI analyses were generally in agreement with whole-brain findings, with significantly lower FA and increased radial diffusion in the ILF in the AD group. Consistent with the retrogenesis model, AD patients showed demonstrable changes in late-myelinating WM fiber pathways. Given greater change in the ILF than the SLF, wallerian degeneration secondary to cortical atrophy may also be a contributing mechanism. Knowledge of the pattern of WM microstructural changes in AD and its underlying mechanisms may contribute to earlier detection and intervention in at-risk groups.},

In early AD cases, we found numerous ATB-stained boutons in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the termination field of neurons from the entorhinal cortex. These AT8-stained boutons co-labeled with synaptophysin, indicating that they represent synaptic boutons in an early state of degeneration. Since the labeled boutons were apposed to or clustered around dendrites or soma that lacked or had less intense staining for AT8 or PHF-1, it appeared that presynaptic events preceded postsynaptic neurofibrillary tangle formation. Furthermore, as a function of disease progression, the pattern of degeneration moved through the circuit. In this progression tau, which is normally localized to axons, becomes redistributed into dendrites and hyperphosphorylated. These observations support the hypothesis that the presynaptic terminal changes may promote the formation of initial neurofibrillary pathology in the postsynaptic neurons via anterograde transneuronal mechanisms and that this initiates a breakdown of routing and sorting mechanisms for the cytoskeletal protein tau.},

Multiple pathways and mechanisms have been proposed to play a role in Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD), yet how they contribute to neuronal vulnerability remains far from clear. In this review, various mechanisms ascribed in AD, PD, ALS, and HD will be briefly summarized. Particular focus will be placed on Rhes-mediated intercellular transport of the HD protein and its role in mitophagy, in which I will discuss some intriguing observations that I apply to model striatal vulnerability in HD.

abstract = {LIS1 (PAFAH1B1) mutation can impair neuronal migration, causing lissencephaly in humans. LIS1 loss is associated with dynein protein motor dysfunction, and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton through disregulated RhoGTPases. Recently, LIS1 was implicated as an important protein-network interaction node with high-risk autism spectrum disorder genes expressed in the synapse. How LIS1 might participate in this disorder has not been investigated. We examined the role of LIS1 in synaptogenesis of post-migrational neurons and social behaviour in mice. Two-photon imaging of actin-rich dendritic filopodia and spines in vivo showed significant reductions in elimination and turnover rates of dendritic protrusions of layer V pyramidal neurons in adolescent Lis1(+/-) mice. Lis1(+/-) filopodia on immature hippocampal neurons in vitro exhibited reduced density, length and RhoA dependent impaired dynamics compared to Lis1(+/+) . Moreover, Lis1(+/-) adolescent mice exhibited deficits in social interaction. Lis1 inactivation restricted to the postnatal hippocampus resulted in similar deficits in dendritic protrusion density and social interactions. Thus, LIS1 plays prominently in dendritic filopodia dynamics and spine turnover implicating reduced dendritic spine plasticity as contributing to developmental autistic-like behaviour.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B1 (LIS1), a critical mediator of neuronal migration in developing brain, is expressed throughout life. However, relatively little is known about LIS1 function in the mature brain. We previously demonstrated that LIS1 involvement in the formation and turnover of synaptic protrusions and synapses of young brain after neuronal migration is complete. Here we examine the requirement for LIS1 to maintain hippocampal circuit function in adulthood. METHODS Effects of conditional Lis1 inactivation in excitatory pyramidal neurons, starting in juvenile mouse brain, were probed using high-resolution approaches combining mouse genetics, designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug technology to specifically manipulate CA1 pyramidal neuron excitatory activity, electrophysiology, hippocampus-selective behavioral testing, and magnetic resonance imaging tractography to examine the connectivity of LIS1-deficient neurons. RESULTS We found progressive excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic dysfunction as soon as 10 days after conditional inactivation of Lis1 targeting CA1 pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, by postnatal day 60 it also caused CA1 histological disorganization, with a selective decline in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and further reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission. Accompanying these changes were behavioral and cognitive deficits that could be rescued by either designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug-directed specific increases in CA1 excitatory transmission or pharmacological enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission. Lagging behind electrophysiological changes was a progressive, selective decline in neural connectivity, affecting hippocampal efferent pathways documented by magnetic resonance imaging tractography. CONCLUSIONS LIS1 supports synaptic function and plasticity of mature CA1 neurons. Postjuvenile loss of LIS1 disrupts the structure and cellular composition of the hippocampus, its connectivity with other brain regions, and cognition dependent on hippocampal circuits.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel subclass-based multi-task learning method for feature selection in computer-aided Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. Unlike the previous methods that often assumed a unimodal data distribution, we take into account the underlying multipeak distribution of classes. The rationale for our approach is that it is highly likely for neuroimaging data to have multiple peaks or modes in distribution, e.g., mixture of Gaussians, due to the inter-subject variability. In this regard, we use a clustering method to discover the multipeak distributional characteristics and define subclasses based on the clustering results, in which each cluster covers a peak in the underlying multipeak distribution. Specifically, after performing clustering for each class, we encode the respective subclasses, i.e., clusters, with their unique codes. In encoding, we impose the subclasses of the same original class close to each other and those of different original classes distinct from each other. By setting the codes as new label vectors of our training samples, we formulate a multi-task learning problem in a ℓ2,1-penalized regression framework, through which we finally select features for classification. In our experimental results on the ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by improving the classification accuracies by 1% (AD vs. Normal Control: NC), 3.25% (MCI vs. NC), 5.34% (AD vs. MCI), and 7.4% (MCI Converter: MCI-C vs. MCI Non-Converter: MCI-NC) compared to the competing single-task learning method. It is remarkable for the performance improvement in MCI-C vs. MCI-NC classification, which is the most important for early diagnosis and treatment. It is also noteworthy that with the strategy of modality-adaptive weights by means of a multi-kernel support vector machine, we maximally achieved the classification accuracies of 96.18% (AD vs. NC), 81.45% (MCI vs. NC), 73.21% (AD vs. MCI), and 74.04% (MCI-C vs. MCI-NC), respectively.},

abstract = {For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)(2), a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET.},

We discovered that three subtypes of GABAergic interneurons in two areas of the mPFC are innervated by same upstream areas. Input from subcortical upstream areas includes cholinergic neurons from the basal forebrain and serotonergic neurons (which co-release glutamate) from the raphe nuclei. Reconstruction of single-neuron morphology revealed novel substantia innominata–anteromedial thalamic nucleus–mPFC and striatum–anteromedial thalamic nucleus–mPFC circuits. Based on the projection logic of individual neurons, we classified cortical and hippocampal input neurons into several types.

abstract = {We developed and applied a Cre-dependent, genetically modified rabies-based tracing system to map direct synaptic connections to specific CA1 neuron types in the mouse hippocampus. We found common inputs to excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons from CA3, CA2, the entorhinal cortex (EC), the medial septum (MS), and, unexpectedly, the subiculum. Excitatory CA1 neurons receive inputs from both cholinergic and GABAergic MS neurons, whereas inhibitory neurons receive a great majority of inputs from GABAergic MS neurons. Both cell types also receive weaker input from glutamatergic MS neurons. Comparisons of inputs to CA1 PV+ interneurons versus SOM+ interneurons showed similar strengths of input from the subiculum, but PV+ interneurons received much stronger input than SOM+ neurons from CA3, the EC, and the MS. Thus, rabies tracing identifies hippocampal circuit connections and maps how the different input sources to CA1 are distributed with different strengths on each of its constituent cell types. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Task-free fMRI data from 21 AD subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the fMRI data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in AD showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p<0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p<0.01) in the AD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished AD participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 78%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in AD. Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in AD, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging.},

[(18)F]-FEPPA PET scans were acquired on a high-resolution research tomograph in 21 patients with AD (47- 81 years) and 21 control subjects (49-82 years). They were analyzed by using a 2-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function. Differences in neuroinflammation, indexed as [(18)F]-FEPPA binding were compared, adjusting for differences in binding affinity class as determined by a single polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971). In grey matter areas, [(18)F]-FEPPA was significantly higher in AD compared with healthy control subjects. Large increases were seen in the hippocampus, prefrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex (average Cohen's d= 0.89). Voxel-based analyses confirmed significant clusters of neuroinflammation in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex in patients with AD. In white matter, [(18)F]-FEPPA binding was elevated in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cingulum bundle. Higher neuroinflammation in the parietal cortex (r= -0.7, P= 0.005), and posterior limb of the internal capsule (r= -0.8, P=0.001) was associated with poorer visuospatial function. In addition, a higher [(18)F]-FEPPA binding in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was associated with a greater impairment in language ability (r= -0.7, P=0.004). Elevated neuroinflammation can be detected in AD patients throughout the brain grey and white matter by using [(18)F]-FEPPA PET. Our results also suggest that neuroinflammation is associated with some cognitive deficits.},

As defined here, they serve to distinguish between 2 alternative, confusable stimulus categories, which may be perceptual or cognitive categories in the psychology laboratory, or different states of the world in practical diagnostic tasks.|The theoretical intent [of the signal detection theory] was to provide a valid model of the discrimination process and the methodological intent was to provide reliable measures of discrimination acuity in specific sensory tasks. . . . The 1st studies showed that an analytical method of detection theory, called the relative operating characteristic (ROC), can isolate the effect of the placement of the decision criterion, which may be variable and idiosyncratic, so that a pure measure of intrinsic discrimination acuity is obtained. The model and methods were then used in other areas of psychology in which discrimination is central, including recognition memory, conceptual judgement, and animal learning. For the past 20 yrs, ROC analysis has also been used to measure the discrimination acuity or inherent accuracy of a broad range of practical diagnostic systems. This book attends to both themes, ROC analysis in the psychology laboratory and in practical diagnostic settings, and to their essential unity, by presenting 12 selected articles.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lewy body and Alzheimer-type pathologies often co-exist. Several studies suggest a synergistic relationship between amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) and $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn) accumulation. We have explored the relationship between A$\beta$ accumulation and the phosphorylation of $\alpha$-syn at serine-129 (pSer129 $\alpha$-syn), in post-mortem human brain tissue and in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected to overexpress human $\alpha$-syn. METHODS: We measured levels of A$\beta$40, A$\beta$42, $\alpha$-syn and pSer129 $\alpha$-syn by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in soluble and insoluble fractions of midfrontal, cingulate and parahippocampal cortex and thalamus, from cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) with (PDD; n = 12) and without dementia (PDND; n = 23), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 10) and age-matched controls (n = 17). We also examined the relationship of these measurements to cognitive decline, as measured by time-to-dementia and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in the PD patients, and to Braak tangle stage. RESULTS: In most brain regions, the concentration of insoluble pSer129 $\alpha$-syn correlated positively, and soluble pSer129 $\alpha$-syn negatively, with the levels of soluble and insoluble A$\beta$. Insoluble pSer129 $\alpha$-syn also correlated positively with Braak stage. In most regions, the levels of insoluble and soluble A$\beta$ and the proportion of insoluble $\alpha$-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 were significantly higher in the PD and DLB groups than the controls, and higher in the PDD and DLB groups than the PDND brains. In PD, the MMSE score correlated negatively with the level of insoluble pSer129 $\alpha$-syn. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to aggregated A$\beta$42 significantly increased the proportion of $\alpha$-syn that was phosphorylated at Ser129 (aggregated A$\beta$40 exposure had a smaller, non-significant effect). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that the concentration of pSer129 $\alpha$-syn in brain tissue homogenates is directly related to the level of A$\beta$ and Braak tangle stage, and predicts cognitive status in Lewy body diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The concept of differing clinical phenotypes within Parkinson's disease (PD) is well represented in the literature. However, there is no consensus as to whether any particular disease phenotype is associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the newly proposed Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria for this feature. AIMS To explore the expression of PD-MCI in relation to the heterogeneity of idiopathic PD. METHODS A cluster analysis incorporating a range of specific demographic, clinical and cognitive variables was performed on 209 patients in the early stages of PD (between Hoehn and Yahr stages I-III). Post hoc analyses exploring variables not included in the clustering solution were performed to interrogate the veracity of the subgroups generated. RESULTS This study identified four distinct PD cohorts: a younger disease-onset subgroup, a tremor dominant subgroup, a non-tremor dominant subgroup, and a subgroup with rapid disease progression. The present study identified a differential expression of PD-MCI across these subgroups, with the highest frequency observed in the non-tremor dominant cluster. The non-tremor dominant subgroup was also associated with a higher prevalence of freezing of gait, hallucinations, daytime somnolence, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder compared with other subgroups. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the existence of heterogeneity within the early clinical stages of PD and for the first time highlights the differential expression of PD-MCI using the newly defined diagnostic criteria for this feature. An improved understanding of PD-MCI and its clinical relationships may lead to an improved understanding of the pathophysiology underlying heterogeneity in PD.},

abstract = {The accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) propagates with characteristic spatiotemporal patterns which follow brain network connections, implying trans-synaptic transmission of tauopathy. Since misfolded tau has been shown to transmit across synapses in AD animal models, we hypothesized that synapses in AD patients may contain misfolded tau. By immunofluorescence imaging of bipartite synapses from AD subjects, we detected tau protein in 38.4% of presynaptic and 50.9% of postsynaptic terminals. The pre/post distribution for hyperphosphorylated tau was 26.9%/30.7%, and for misfolded tau 18.3%/19.3%. In the temporal cortex, microscopic aggregates of tau, containing ultra-stable oligomers, were estimated to accumulate within trillions of synapses, outnumbering macroscopic tau aggregates such as tangles by 10000 fold. Non-demented elderly also showed considerable synaptic tau hyperphosphorylation and some misfolding, implicating the synapse as one of the first subcellular compartments affected by tauopathy. Misfolding of tau protein appeared to occur in situ inside synaptic terminals, without mislocalizing or mistrafficking. Misfolded tau at synapses may represent early signs of neuronal degeneration, mediators of synaptotoxicity, and anatomical substrates for transmitting tauopathy, but its actual role in these processes remain to be elucidated.},

DT imaging was performed using a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner in ten probable AD patients with no or only mild changes in the white matter in T2 weighted magnetic resonance imagings and ten group-matched controls. The values of fractional anisotropy were significantly lower in the temporal subcortical white matter, posterior part of the corpus callosum, and anterior and posterior cingulate bundles in patients with AD compared with controls. Possible relationships of these selective impairments in the white matter with pathological changes in the posterior cerebral cortices and hippocampus were discussed.},

However, the tau species involved in inter-neuron propagation remains unclear. To identify tau species responsible for propagation, we examined uptake and propagation properties of different tau species derived from postmortem cortical extracts and brain interstitial fluid of tau-transgenic mice, as well as human AD cortices. Here we show that PBS-soluble phosphorylated high-molecular-weight (HMW) tau, though very low in abundance, is taken up, axonally transported, and passed on to synaptically connected neurons. Our findings suggest that a rare species of soluble phosphorylated HMW tau is the endogenous form of tau involved in propagation and could be a target for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development.},

abstract = {A central question in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is what role $\beta$-amyloid peptide (A$\beta$) plays in synaptic dysfunction. Synaptic activity increases A$\beta$ secretion, potentially inhibiting synapses, but also decreases intraneuronal A$\beta$, protecting synapses. We now show that levels of secreted A$\beta$ fall with time in culture in neurons of AD-transgenic mice, but not wild-type mice. Moreover, the ability of synaptic activity to elevate secreted A$\beta$ and reduce intraneuronal A$\beta$ becomes impaired in AD-transgenic but not wild-type neurons with time in culture. We demonstrate that synaptic activity promotes an increase in the A$\beta$-degrading protease neprilysin at the cell surface and a concomitant increase in colocalization with A$\beta$42. Remarkably, AD-transgenic but not wild-type neurons show reduced levels of neprilysin with time in culture. This impaired ability to secrete A$\beta$ and reduce intraneuronal A$\beta$ has important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.},

abstract = {Polarized growth of the neuron would logically require some form of membrane traffic to the tip of the growth cone, regulated in conjunction with other trafficking processes that are common to both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Unlike axons, dendrites are endowed with membranous organelles of the exocytic pathway extending from the cell soma, including both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Dendrites also have satellite Golgi-like cisternal stacks known as Golgi outposts that have no membranous connections with the somatic Golgi. Golgi outposts presumably serve both general and specific local trafficking needs, and could mediate membrane traffic required for polarized dendritic growth during neuronal differentiation. Recent findings suggest that dendritic growth, but apparently not axonal growth, relies very much on classical exocytic traffic, and is affected by defects in components of both the early and late secretory pathways. Within dendrites, localized processes of recycling endosome-based exocytosis regulate the growth of dendritic spines and postsynaptic compartments. Emerging membrane traffic processes and components that contribute specifically to dendritic growth are discussed.},

abstract = {Precise neural circuit assembly is achieved by initial overproduction of neurons and synapses, followed by refinement through elimination of exuberant neurons and synapses. Glial cells are the primary cells responsible for clearing neuronal debris, but the cellular and molecular basis of glial pruning is poorly defined. Here we show that Drosophila larval astrocytes transform into phagocytes through activation of a cell-autonomous, steroid-dependent program at the initiation of metamorphosis and are the primary phagocytic cell type in the pupal neuropil. We examined the developmental elimination of two neuron populations — mushroom body (MB) $\gamma$ neurons and vCrz + neurons (expressing Corazonin [Crz] neuropeptide in the ventral nerve cord [VNC])—where only neurites are pruned or entire cells are eliminated, respectively. We found that MB $\gamma$ axons are engulfed by astrocytes using the Draper and Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 signaling pathways in a partially redundant manner. In contrast, while elimination of vCrz + cell bodies requires Draper, elimination of vCrz + neurites is mediated by Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 but not Draper. Intriguingly, we also found that elimination of Draper delayed vCrz + neurite degeneration, suggesting that glia promote neurite destruction through engulfment signaling. This study identifies a novel role for astrocytes in the clearance of synaptic and neuronal debris and for Crk/Mbc/dCed-12 as a new glial pathway mediating pruning and reveals, unexpectedly, that the engulfment signaling pathways engaged by glia depend on whether neuronal debris was generated through cell death or local pruning.},

abstract = {Prions are the causative agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. In these prion diseases the normal cellular form of the prion protein (PrP(C)) undergoes a post-translational conformational conversion to the infectious form (PrP(Sc)). PrP(C) associates with cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich lipid rafts through association of its glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor with saturated raft lipids and through interaction of its N-terminal region with an as yet unidentified raft associated molecule. PrP(C) resides in detergent-resistant domains that have different lipid and protein compositions to the domains occupied by another GPI-anchored protein, Thy-1. In some cells PrP(C) may endocytose through caveolae, but in neuronal cells, upon copper binding to the N-terminal octapeptide repeats, the protein translocates out of rafts into detergent-soluble regions of the plasma membrane prior to endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits. The current data suggest that the polybasic region at its N-terminus is required to engage PrP(C) with a transmembrane adaptor protein which in turn links with the clathrin endocytic machinery. PrP(C) associates in rafts with a variety of signalling molecules, including caveolin-1 and Fyn and Src tyrosine kinases. The clustering of PrP(C) triggers a range of signal transduction processes, including the recruitment of the neural cell adhesion molecule to rafts which in turn promotes neurite outgrowth. Lipid rafts appear to be involved in the conformational conversion of PrP(C) to PrP(Sc), possibly by providing a favourable environment for this process to occur and enabling disease progression.},

abstract = {The clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM) gene encodes a putative homologue of the clathrin assembly synaptic protein AP180. Hence the biochemical properties, the subcellular localization, and the role in endocytosis of a CALM protein were studied. In vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the clathrin heavy chain is the major binding partner of CALM. The bulk of cellular CALM was associated with the membrane fractions of the cell and localized to clathrin-coated areas of the plasma membrane. In the membrane fraction, CALM was present at near stoichiometric amounts relative to clathrin. To perform structure–function analysis of CALM, we engineered chimeric fusion proteins of CALM and its fragments with the green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP–CALM was targeted to the plasma membrane–coated pits and also found colocalized with clathrin in the Golgi area. High levels of expression of GFP–CALM or its fragments with clathrin-binding activity inhibited the endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor receptors and altered the steady-state distribution of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in the cell. In addition, GFP–CALM overexpression caused the loss of clathrin accumulation in the trans-Golgi network area, whereas the localization of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1 in the trans-Golgi network remained unaffected. The ability of the GFP-tagged fragments of CALM to affect clathrin-mediated processes correlated with the targeting of the fragments to clathrin-coated areas and their clathrin-binding capacities. Clathrin–CALM interaction seems to be regulated by multiple contact interfaces. The C-terminal part of CALM binds clathrin heavy chain, although the full-length protein exhibited maximal ability for interaction. Altogether, the data suggest that CALM is an important component of coated pit internalization machinery, possibly involved in the regulation of clathrin recruitment to the membrane and/or the formation of the coated pit.},

abstract = {There are two distinct inhibitory GABAergic circuits in the neostriatum. The feedforward circuit consists of a relatively small population of GABAergic interneurons that receives excitatory input from the neocortex and exerts monosynaptic inhibition onto striatal spiny projection neurons. The feedback circuit comprises the numerous spiny projection neurons and their interconnections via local axon collaterals. This network has long been assumed to provide the majority of striatal GABAergic inhibition and to sharpen and shape striatal output through lateral inhibition, producing increased activity in the most strongly excited spiny cells at the expense of their less strongly excited neighbors. Recent results, mostly from recording experiments of synaptically connected pairs of neurons, have revealed that the two GABAergic circuits differ markedly in terms of the total number of synapses made by each, the strength of the postsynaptic response detected at the soma, the extent of presynaptic convergence and divergence and the net effect of the activation of each circuit on the postsynaptic activity of the spiny neuron. These data have revealed that the feedforward inhibition is powerful and widespread, with spiking in a single interneuron being capable of significantly delaying or even blocking the generation of spikes in a large number of postsynaptic spiny neurons. In contrast, the postsynaptic effects of spiking in a single presynaptic spiny neuron on postsynaptic spiny neurons are weak when measured at the soma, and unable to significantly affect spike timing or generation. Further, reciprocity of synaptic connections between spiny neurons is only rarely observed. These results suggest that the bulk of the fast inhibition that has the strongest effects on spiny neuron spike timing comes from the feedforward interneuronal system whereas the axon collateral feedback system acts principally at the dendrites to control local excitability as well as the overall level of activity of the spiny neuron. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess Wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract within the first 2 weeks after ischemic stroke, and correlated the extent of Wallerian degeneration with the motor deficit. Nine patients with middle cerebral artery stroke were examined 2-16 days after stroke by DTI and T2-weighted MRI. We measured fractional anisotropy (FA), averaged diffusivity (Dav), eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor and T2-weighted signal in the cerebral peduncle and compared these values between the affected and the unaffected side and between patients and six controls. FA was significantly reduced on the affected side compared to the unaffected side and compared to the control group. The largest eigenvalue was reduced, whereas the smallest eigenvalue was elevated on the affected side. There was no significant difference in T2-weighted signal and Dav. The decrease of anisotropy correlated positively with the motor deficit at the time of DTI study and 90 days after stroke. The reduction of anisotropy mirrors the disintegration of axonal structures, as it occurs in the early phase of Wallerian degeneration. DTI detects changes of water diffusion related to beginning pyramidal tract degeneration within the first 2 weeks after stroke that are not yet visible in conventional T2-weighted or orientationally averaged diffusion weighted MRI. We demonstrated for the first time a correlation of early DTI findings of pyramidal tract damage with the motor deficit. DTI can help prognosing recovery of motor function after stroke within the early subacute phase.},

abstract = {We detected and mapped a dynamically spreading wave of gray matter loss in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere > right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 +/- 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 +/- 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 +/- 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later (>15% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 +/- 2.3% per year in AD v 0.9 +/- 0.9% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

abstract = {Overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in hippocampal neurons leads to elevated beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) production and consequent depression of excitatory transmission. The precise mechanisms underlying APP-induced synaptic depression are poorly understood. Uncovering these mechanisms could provide insight into how neuronal function is compromised before cell death during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Here we verify that APP up-regulation leads to depression of transmission in cultured hippocampal autapses; and we perform whole-cell recording, FM imaging, and immunocytochemistry to identify the specific mechanisms accounting for this depression. We find that APP overexpression leads to postsynaptic silencing through a selective reduction of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated currents. This effect is likely mediated by Abeta because expression of mutant APP incapable of producing Abeta did not depress transmission. In addition, although we eliminate presynaptic silencing as a mechanism underlying APP-mediated inhibition of transmission, we did observe an Abeta-induced presynaptic deficit in vesicle recycling with sustained stimulation. These findings demonstrate that APP elevation disrupts both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments.},

Previously, this knowledge was severely limited, as it was difficult to visualize these structures or measure their functions in vivo. The HCP has recently generated considerable interest because of its potential to explore connectivity and its relationship with genetics and behavior. For neuroscientists and the lay public alike, the ability to assess, measure, and explore this wealth of layered information concerning how the brain is wired is a much sought after prize.The navigation of the human connectome and the discovery of how it is affected through genetics, and in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases, have far reaching implications. From a range of ongoing connectomics related activities, the systematic characterization of brain connectedness and the resulting functional aspects of such connectivity will not only realize the work of Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal and others, but will also greatly expand our understanding of the brain, the mind, and what it is to be truly human. The similarities and differences that mark normal diversity will help us to understand variation among people and set the stage to chart genetic influences on typical brain development and decline during aging. What is more, an understanding of how brains might become disordered will shed light on autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and other diseases that exact a tremendous and terrible social and economic toll.},

However, information on clinical and biomarker correlates of Apo-E proteins is scarce. We examined the relationship of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma Apo-E protein levels, and APOE genotype to cognition and AD biomarker changes in 311 AD neuroimaging initiative subjects with CSF Apo-E measurements and 565 subjects with plasma Apo-E measurements. At baseline, higher CSF Apo-E levels were associated with higher total and phosphorylated CSF tau levels. CSF Apo-E levels were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline, MCI conversion to dementia, and gray matter atrophy rate in total tau/A$\beta$1-42 ratio and APOE genotype-adjusted analyses. In analyses stratified by APOE genotype, our results were only significant in the group without the $\epsilon$4 allele. Baseline CSF Apo-E levels did not predict longitudinal CSF A$\beta$ or tau changes. Plasma Apo-E levels show a mild correlation with CSF Apo-E levels, but were not associated with longitudinal cognitive and MRI changes. Based on our analyses, we speculate that increased CSF Apo-E2 or -E3 levels might represent a protective response to injury in AD and may have neuroprotective effects by decreasing neuronal damage independent of tau and amyloid deposition in addition to its effects on amyloid clearance.},

The Dem-AD-LB individuals showed relative preservation of substantia nigra cells and dopamine active transporter in putamen. PD cases with AD pathology showed increased LRP. The cluster with occipital LRP was associated with non-AD type dementia clinical diagnosis in the Dem-AD-LB group and a faster progression to dementia in the PD groups. We found that (1) LRP pathology in Dem-AD-LB shows a distribution that differs from PD, without significant brainstem or extracranial LRP in initial phases; (2) coincident AD pathology is associated with increased LRP in PD indicating an interaction; (3) LRP and coincident AD pathology independently predict progression to dementia in PD, and (4) evaluation of LRP needs to acknowledge different LRP spreading patterns and evaluate substantia nigra integrity in the neuropathological assessment and consider the implications of neuropathological heterogeneity for clinical and biomarker characterization.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the emergence and spread of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, causing widespread neurodegeneration. Though the progression of Alzheimer's disease is considered to be stereotyped, the significant variability within clinical populations obscures this interpretation on the individual level. Of particular clinical importance is understanding where exactly pathology, e.g. tau, emerges in each patient and how the incipient atrophy pattern relates to future spread of disease. Here we demonstrate a newly developed graph theoretical method of inferring prior disease states in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using an established network diffusion model and an L1-penalized optimization algorithm. Although the 'seeds' of origin using our inference method successfully reproduce known trends in Alzheimer's disease staging on a population level, we observed that the high degree of heterogeneity between patients at baseline is also reflected in their seeds. Additionally, the individualized seeds are significantly more predictive of future atrophy than a single seed placed at the hippocampus. Our findings illustrate that understanding where disease originates in individuals is critical to determining how it progresses and that our method allows us to infer early stages of disease from atrophy patterns observed at diagnosis.},

We simulated the spatiotemporal profiles of soluble and insoluble tau species in a multicompartment, two-neuron system using biologically plausible parameters and time scales. Changes in the balance of tau transport feedback parameters can elicit anterograde and retrograde biases in the distributions of soluble and insoluble tau between compartments in the system. Aggregation and fragmentation parameters can also perturb this balance, suggesting a complex interplay between these distinct molecular processes. Critically, we show that the model faithfully recreates the characteristic network spread biases in both AD-like and non-AD-like mouse tauopathy models. Tau transport feedback may therefore help link microscopic differences in tau conformational states and the resulting variety in clinical presentations.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation in the brain is thought to be one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease, possibly leading to synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cognitive/functional decline. The earliest detectable changes seen with neuroimaging appear to be amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation detected by (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging. However, some individuals tolerate high brain amyloid-$\beta$ loads without developing symptoms, while others progressively decline, suggesting that events in the brain downstream from amyloid-$\beta$ deposition, such as regional brain atrophy rates, play an important role. The main purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between the regional distributions of increased amyloid-$\beta$ and the regional distribution of increased brain atrophy rates in patients with mild cognitive impairment. To simultaneously capture the spatial distributions of amyloid-$\beta$ and brain atrophy rates, we employed the statistical concept of parallel independent component analysis, an effective method for joint analysis of multimodal imaging data. Parallel independent component analysis identified significant relationships between two patterns of amyloid-$\beta$ deposition and atrophy rates: (i) increased amyloid-$\beta$ burden in the left precuneus/cuneus and medial-temporal regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the left medial-temporal and parietal regions; and (ii) in contrast, increased amyloid-$\beta$ burden in bilateral precuneus/cuneus and parietal regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the right medial temporal regions. The spatial distribution of increased amyloid-$\beta$ and the associated spatial distribution of increased brain atrophy rates embrace a characteristic pattern of brain structures known for a high vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology, encouraging for the use of (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography measures as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease. These results may begin to shed light on the mechanisms by which amyloid-$\beta$ deposition leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and the development of a more specific Alzheimer's disease-specific imaging signature for diagnosis and use of this knowledge in the development of new anti-therapies for Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) locus is one of the most remarkable in neurogenetics due not only to its involvement in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Parksinson's disease and possibly Alzheimer's disease, but also due its genetic evolution and complex alternative splicing features which are, to some extent, linked and so all the more intriguing. Therefore, obtaining robust information regarding the expression, splicing and genetic regulation of this gene within the human brain is of immense importance. In this study, we used 2011 brain samples originating from 439 individuals to provide the most reliable and coherent information on the regional expression, splicing and regulation of MAPT available to date. We found significant regional variation in mRNA expression and splicing of MAPT within the human brain. Furthermore, at the gene level, the regional distribution of mRNA expression and total tau protein expression levels were largely in agreement, appearing to be highly correlated. Finally and most importantly, we show that while the reported H1/H2 association with gene level expression is likely to be due to a technical artefact, this polymorphism is associated with the expression of exon 3-containing isoforms in human brain. These findings would suggest that contrary to the prevailing view, genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases at the MAPT locus are likely to operate by changing mRNA splicing in different brain regions, as opposed to the overall expression of the MAPT gene.},

abstract = {Here, we review progress by the Penn Biomarker Core in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) toward developing a pathological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarker signature for mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as a biomarker profile that predicts conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and/or normal control subjects to AD. The Penn Biomarker Core also collaborated with other ADNI Cores to integrate data across ADNI to temporally order changes in clinical measures, imaging data, and chemical biomarkers that serve as mileposts and predictors of the conversion of normal control to MCI as well as MCI to AD, and the progression of AD. Initial CSF studies by the ADNI Biomarker Core revealed a pathological CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by the combination of Abeta1-42 and total tau (T-tau) that effectively delineates mild AD in the large multisite prospective clinical investigation conducted in ADNI. This signature appears to predict conversion from MCI to AD. Data fusion efforts across ADNI Cores generated a model for the temporal ordering of AD biomarkers which suggests that Abeta amyloid biomarkers become abnormal first, followed by changes in neurodegenerative biomarkers (CSF tau, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) with the onset of clinical symptoms. The timing of these changes varies in individual patients due to genetic and environmental factors that increase or decrease an individual's resilience in response to progressive accumulations of AD pathologies. Further studies in ADNI will refine this model and render the biomarkers studied in ADNI more applicable to routine diagnosis and to clinical trials of disease modifying therapies.},

Numeric neuroimaging variables generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-funded laboratories for each neuroimaging modality along with apolipoprotein-E genotype (n = 29) were analyzed. Performance of these biomarkers for predicting conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia at 2 years was evaluated in 50 late amnestic MCI subjects, 20 of whom converted. Multivariate modeling found that among individual modalities, MRI had the highest predictive accuracy (67%) which increased by 9% to 76% when combined with PIB-PET, producing the highest accuracy among any biomarker combination. Individually, PIB-PET generated the best sensitivity, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET had the lowest. Among individual brain regions, the temporal cortex was found to be most predictive for MRI and PIB-PET.},

abstract = {Background: The thalamus is a major neural hub, with selective connections to virtually all cortical regions of the brain. The multisystem neurodegenerative syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has pathogenic overlap with frontotemporal dementia, and objective in vivo markers of extra-motor pathological spread are lacking. To better consider the role of the thalamus in neurodegeneration, the present study assessed the integrity of the thalamus and its connectivity to major cortical regions of the brain in a longitudinal manner. Methods: Diffusion-based MRI tractography was used to parcellate the thalamus into distinct regions based on structural thalamo-cortical connectivity in 20 patients with ALS, half of whom were scanned at two time points, and 31 matched controls scanned on a single occasion. Results: At baseline, widespread diffusivity alterations in motor- and extramotor-associated thalamic parcellations were detectable. Longitudinal decline selectively affected thalamic regions associated with frontal and temporal lobe connectivity. Diffusivity measures were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disease burden. Progression of functional disability, as indicated by change on the ALS functional rating scale, was associated with longitudinal change in mean diffusivity of the right frontal lobe thalamic parcellation (r=0.59, p=0.05). Conclusions: Regional thalamic connectivity changes mirror the progressive frontotemporal cortical involvement associated with the motor functional decline in ALS. Longitudinal MRI thalamic parcellation has potential as a non-invasive surrogate marker of cortical dysfunction in ALS.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform, also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction algorithm are discussed.},

abstract = {The striatum acts in conjunction with the cortex to control and execute functions that are impaired by abnormal dopamine neurotransmission in disorders such as Parkinson's and schizophrenia. To date, in vivo quantification of striatal dopamine has been restricted to structure-based striatal subdivisions. Here, we present a multimodal imaging approach that quantifies the endogenous dopamine release following the administration of d-amphetamine in the functional subdivisions of the striatum of healthy humans with [(11)C]PHNO and [(11)C]Raclopride positron emission tomography ligands. Using connectivity-based (CB) parcellation, we subdivided the striatum into functional subregions based on striato-cortical anatomical connectivity information derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and probabilistic tractography. Our parcellation showed that the functional organization of the striatum was spatially coherent across individuals, congruent with primate data and previous diffusion MRI studies, with distinctive and overlapping networks. d-amphetamine induced the highest dopamine release in the limbic followed by the sensory, motor, and executive areas. The data suggest that the relative regional proportions of D2-like receptors are unlikely to be responsible for this regional dopamine release pattern. Notably, the homogeneity of dopamine release was significantly higher within the CB functional subdivisions in comparison with the structural subdivisions. These results support an association between local levels of dopamine release and cortical connectivity fingerprints.},

Med. Imag. 17, 463-468) was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

abstract = {Tau and alpha-synuclein are both proteins implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have investigated the mechanisms of axonal transport of tau and alpha-synuclein, because failure of axonal transport has been implicated in the development of several neurodegenerative disorders. We found that the transport of both of these proteins depend on an intact microtubule- but not actin-cytoskeleton, and that tau and alpha-synuclein both move at overall slow rates of transport. We used time-lapse video microscopy to obtain images of live neurons that had been transfected with plasmids expressing proteins tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein. We found that particulate structures containing tau or alpha-synuclein travel rapidly when moving along axons but spend the majority of the time paused, and these structures have similar characteristics to those previously observed for neurofilaments. The motile particles containing tau or alpha-synuclein colocalise with the fast-transporting molecular motor kinesin-1 in neurons. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that tau and alpha-synuclein are each associated with complexes containing kinesin-1, whereas only alpha-synuclein appears to interact with dynein-containing complexes. In vitro glutathione S-transferase-binding assays using rat brain homogenate or recombinant protein as bait reveals a direct interaction of kinesin-1 light chains 1 and 2 with tau, but not with alpha-synuclein. Our findings suggest that the axonal transport of tau occurs via a mechanism utilising fast transport motors, including the kinesin family of proteins, and that alpha-synuclein transport in neurons may involve both kinesin and dynein motor proteins.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by degeneration of the nigrostrial connection causing dramatic changes in the dopaminergic pathway underlying clinical pathology. Till now, no MRI tools were available to follow up any specific PD-related neurodegeneration. However, recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has received considerable attention as a new and potential in vivo diagnostic tool for various neurodegenerative diseases. To assess this in PD, we performed DTI in the acute 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD to evaluate diffusion properties in the degenerating nigrostriatal pathway and its connecting structures. Injection of a neurotoxin in the striatum causes retrograde neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal tract, and selective degeneration of nigral neurons. The advantage of this model is that the lesion size is well controllable by the injected dose of the toxin. The degree of functional impairment was evaluated in vivo using the amphetamine rotation test and microPET imaging of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Despite a nearly complete lesion of the nigrostriatal tract, DTI changes were limited to the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN). In this study we demonstrate, using voxel-based statistics (VBS), an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA), whereas all eigenvalues were significantly decreased. VBS enabled us to visualise neurodegeneration of a cluster of neurons but failed to detect degeneration of more diffuse microstructures such as the nigrostriatal fibres or the dopaminergic endings in the striatum. VBS without a priori information proved to be better than manual segmentation of brain structures as it does not suffer from volume averaging and is not susceptible to erroneous segmentations of brain regions that show very little contrast on MRI images such as SN.},

abstract = {With the mapping of macroscale connectomes by means of in vivo diffusion-weighted MR Imaging (DWI) rapidly gaining in popularity, one of the necessary steps is the examination of metrics of connectivity strength derived from these reconstructions. In the field of human macroconnectomics the number of reconstructed fiber streamlines (NOS) is more and more used as a metric of cortico-cortical interareal connectivity strength, but the link between DWI NOS and in vivo animal tract-tracing measurements of anatomical connectivity strength remains poorly understood. In this technical report, we communicate on a comparison between DWI derived metrics and tract-tracing metrics of projection strength. Tract-tracing information on projection strength of interareal pathways was extracted from two commonly used macaque connectome datasets, including (1) the CoCoMac database of collated tract-tracing experiments of the macaque brain and (2) the high-resolution tract-tracing dataset of Markov and Kennedy and coworkers. NOS and density of reconstructed fiber pathways derived from DWI data acquired across 10 rhesus macaques was found to positively correlate to tract-tracing based measurements of connectivity strength across both the CoCoMac and Markov dataset (both P < 0.001), suggesting DWI NOS to form a valid method of assessment of the projection strength of white matter pathways. Our findings provide confidence of in vivo DWI connectome reconstructions to represent fairly realistic estimates of the wiring strength of white matter projections. Our cross-modal comparison supports the notion of in vivo DWI to be a valid methodology for robust description and interpretation of brain wiring.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore relations between spatial distribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and disability. In MS, the presence of asymptomatic brain lesions challenges the prediction of disability based on conventional brain MRI. Hypothesizing that symptomatology may partly be determined by lesion location, this retrospective study explored relations between lesion location and disability using voxelwise analyses in standard space. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using nonparametric permutation-based statistics, voxelwise lesion probability on T2 lesion masks was related to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and MS functional composite (MSFC) subdomain scores and demographic characteristics of 325 MS patients. To identify statistically significant locations, a cluster-forming threshold of 3.1 was used. RESULTS: In clusters in the periventricular region, lesion probability correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with disability and disease duration, and was higher in progressive than in relapsing disease. When controlled for lesion load (LL), no significant clusters survived. Presence and number of spinal cord lesions did not correlate with lesion probability in any location, and did not influence correlations with disability when included in its analyses. CONCLUSION: Periventricular lesions were related to disability. LL influenced relations between disability and lesion probability throughout the brain, suggesting interplay between lesional burden and its location in determining disability in MS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between baseline MRI and CSF biomarkers and subsequent change in continuous measures of cognitive and functional abilities in cognitively normal (CN) subjects and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and to examine the ability of these biomarkers to predict time to conversion from aMCI to AD. METHODS: Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which consists of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both CSF and MRI, were used. Baseline CSF (t-tau, Abeta(1-42), and p-tau(181P)) and MRI scans were obtained in 399 subjects (109 CN, 192 aMCI, 98 AD). Structural Abnormality Index (STAND) scores, which reflect the degree of AD-like features in MRI, were computed for each subject. RESULTS: Change on continuous measures of cognitive and functional performance was modeled as average Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes and Mini-Mental State Examination scores over a 2-year period. STAND was a better predictor of subsequent cognitive/functional change than CSF biomarkers. Single-predictor Cox proportional hazard models for time to conversion from aMCI to AD showed that STAND and log (t-tau/Abeta(1-42)) were both predictive of future conversion. The age-adjusted hazard ratio for an interquartile change (95% confidence interval) of STAND was 2.6 (1.7, 4.2) and log (t-tau/Abeta(1-42)) was 2.0 (1.1, 3.4). Both MRI and CSF provided information about future cognitive change even after adjusting for baseline cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: MRI and CSF provide complimentary predictive information about time to conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease and combination of the 2 provides better prediction than either source alone. However, we found that MRI was a slightly better predictor of future clinical/functional decline than the CSF biomarkers tested.},

abstract = {The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) does not exactly match the pathological findings at autopsy in every subject. Therefore, in-vivo imaging measures, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that reflect underlying pathology, would be clinically useful independent supplementary measures of disease stage. We have developed an algorithm that extracts atrophy information from individual patient's 3D MRI scans and assigns a STructural Abnormality iNDex (STAND)-score to the scan based on the degree of atrophy in comparison to patterns extracted from a large library of clinically well characterized AD and CN (cognitively normal) subject's MRI scans. STAND-scores can be adjusted for demographics to give adjusted-STAND (aSTAND)-scores which are >0 for subjects with brains identified as abnormal by the algorithm. Since histopathological findings are considered to represent the "ground truth", our objective was to assess the sensitivity of aSTAND-scores to pathological AD staging. This was done by comparing antemortem MRI based aSTAND-scores with postmortem grading of disease severity in 101 subjects who had both antemortem MRI and postmortem Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) staging. We found a rank correlation of 0.62 (p<0.0001) between Braak NFT stage and aSTAND-scores. The results show that optimally extracted information from MRI scans such as STAND-scores accurately capture the severity of neuronal pathology and can be used as an independent approximate surrogate marker for in-vivo pathological staging as well as for early identification of AD in individual subjects.},

We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with the known AD literature.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease selectively affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Patients with ALS suffer from progressive paralysis and eventually die on average after three years. The underlying neurobiology of upper motor neuron degeneration and its effects on the complex network of the brain are, however, largely unknown. Here, we examined the effects of ALS on the structural brain network topology in 35 patients with ALS and 19 healthy controls. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the brain network was reconstructed for each individual participant. The connectivity of this reconstructed brain network was compared between patients and controls using complexity theory without--a priori selected--regions of interest. Patients with ALS showed an impaired sub-network of regions with reduced white matter connectivity (p = 0.0108, permutation testing). This impaired sub-network was strongly centered around primary motor regions (bilateral precentral gyrus and right paracentral lobule), including secondary motor regions (bilateral caudal middle frontal gyrus and pallidum) as well as high-order hub regions (right posterior cingulate and precuneus). In addition, we found a significant reduction in overall efficiency (p = 0.0095) and clustering (p = 0.0415). From our findings, we conclude that upper motor neuron degeneration in ALS affects both primary motor connections as well as secondary motor connections, together composing an impaired sub-network. The degenerative process in ALS was found to be widespread, but interlinked and targeted to the motor connectome.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease, which primarily targets the motor system. The structural integrity of the motor network and the way it is embedded in the overall brain network is essential for motor functioning. We studied the longitudinal effects of ALS on the brain network using diffusion tensor imaging and questioned whether over time an increasing number of connections become involved or whether there is progressive impairment of a limited number of connections. The brain network was reconstructed based on "whole brain" diffusion tensor imaging data. We examined: (1) network integrity in 24 patients with ALS at baseline (T = 1) and at a more advanced stage of the disease (T = 2; interval 5.5 months) compared with a group of healthy controls and (2) progressive brain network impairment comparing patients at two time-points in a paired-analysis. These analyses demonstrated an expanding subnetwork of affected brain connections over time with a central role for the primary motor regions (P-values T = 1 0.003; T = 2 0.001). Loss of structural connectivity mainly propagated to frontal and parietal brain regions at T = 2 compared with T = 1. No progressive impairment of the initially affected (motor) connections could be detected. The main finding of this study is an increasing loss of network structure in patients with ALS. In contrast to the theory of ALS solely affecting a fixed set of primary motor connections, our findings show that the network of impaired connectivity is expanding over time. These results are in support of disease spread along structural brain connections. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The first PLS component defined a transcriptional profile associated with high intra-modular degree and short connection distance, whereas the second PLS component was associated with high inter-modular degree and long connection distance. Nodes in superior and lateral cortex with high inter-modular degree and long connection distance had local transcriptional profiles enriched for oxidative metabolism and mitochondria, and for genes specific to supragranular layers of human cortex. In contrast, primary and secondary sensory cortical nodes in posterior cortex with high intra-modular degree and short connection distance had transcriptional profiles enriched for RNA translation and nuclear components. We conclude that, as predicted, topologically integrative hubs, mediating long-distance connections between modules, are more costly in terms of mitochondrial glucose metabolism.},

abstract = {In early Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hippocampal region is the area most severely affected by cellular and structural alterations, yet glucose hypometabolism predominates in the posterior association cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus. One prevalent hypothesis to account for this discrepancy is that posterior cingulate hypometabolism results from disconnection from the hippocampus through disruption of the cingulum bundle. However, only partial and indirect evidence currently supports this hypothesis. Thus, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 18 patients with early AD, we assessed the relationships between hippocampal atrophy, white matter integrity, and gray matter metabolism by means of a whole-brain voxel-based correlative approach. We found that hippocampal atrophy is specifically related to cingulum bundle disruption, which is in turn highly correlated to hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex but also of the middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (all part of Papez's circuit), as well as the right temporoparietal associative cortex. These results provide the first direct evidence supporting the disconnection hypothesis as a major factor contributing to the early posterior hypometabolism in AD. Disruption of the cingulum bundle also appears to relate to hypometabolism in a large connected network over and above the posterior cingulate cortex, encompassing the whole memory circuit of Papez (consistent with the key location of this white matter tract within this loop) and also, but indirectly, the right posterior association cortex.},

abstract = {Hippocampal atrophy, posterior cingulate and frontal glucose hypometabolism, and white-matter tract disruption are well described early macroscopic events in Alzheimer's disease. The relationships between these three types of alterations have been documented in previous studies, but their chronology still remains to be established. The present study used multi-modal fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging longitudinal data to address this question in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. We found unidirectional, specific sequential relationships between: (i) baseline hippocampal atrophy and both cingulum bundle (r = 0.70; P = 3 × 10⁻³) and uncinate fasciculus (r = 0.75; P = 7 × 10⁻⁴) rate of atrophy; (ii) baseline cingulum bundle atrophy and rate of decline of posterior (r = 0.72; P = 2 × 10⁻³); and anterior (r = 0.74; P = 1 × 10⁻³) cingulate metabolism; and (iii) baseline uncinate white matter atrophy and subgenual metabolism rate of change (r = 0.65; P = 6 × 10⁻³). Baseline local grey matter atrophy was not found to contribute to hypometabolism progression within the posterior and anterior cingulate as well as subgenual cortices. These findings suggest that hippocampal atrophy progressively leads to disruption of the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus, which in turn leads to glucose hypometabolism of the cingulate and subgenual cortices, respectively. This study reinforces the relevance of remote mechanisms above local interactions to account for the pattern of metabolic brain alteration observed in amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and provides new avenues to assess the sequence of events in complex diseases characterized by multiple manifestations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Similar to most chronic diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops slowly from a preclinical phase into a fully expressed clinical syndrome. We aimed to use longitudinal data to calculate the rates of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition, cerebral atrophy, and cognitive decline.

METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months. At every visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET scan. We included participants with three or more (11)C-PiB PET follow-up assessments. A$\beta$ burden was expressed as (11)C-PiB standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) with the cerebellar cortex as reference region. An SUVR of 1{\textperiodcentered}5 was used to discriminate high from low A$\beta$ burdens. The slope of the regression plots over 3-5 years was used to estimate rates of change for A$\beta$ deposition, MRI volumetrics, and cognition. We included those participants with a positive rate of A$\beta$ deposition to calculate the trajectory of each variable over time.

FINDINGS: 200 participants (145 healthy controls, 36 participants with MCI, and 19 participants with AD) were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months for a mean follow-up of 3{\textperiodcentered}8 (95% CI CI 3{\textperiodcentered}6-3{\textperiodcentered}9) years. At baseline, significantly higher A$\beta$ burdens were noted in patients with AD (2{\textperiodcentered}27, SD 0{\textperiodcentered}43) and those with MCI (1{\textperiodcentered}94, 0{\textperiodcentered}64) than in healthy controls (1{\textperiodcentered}38, 0{\textperiodcentered}39). At follow-up, 163 (82%) of the 200 participants showed positive rates of A$\beta$ accumulation. A$\beta$ deposition was estimated to take 19{\textperiodcentered}2 (95% CI 16{\textperiodcentered}8-22{\textperiodcentered}5) years in an almost linear fashion-with a mean increase of 0{\textperiodcentered}043 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}037-0{\textperiodcentered}049) SUVR per year-to go from the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity (1{\textperiodcentered}5 SUVR) to the levels observed in AD. It was estimated to take 12{\textperiodcentered}0 (95% CI 10{\textperiodcentered}1-14{\textperiodcentered}9) years from the levels observed in healthy controls with low A$\beta$ deposition (1{\textperiodcentered}2 [SD 0{\textperiodcentered}1] SUVR) to the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity. As AD progressed, the rate of A$\beta$ deposition slowed towards a plateau. Our projections suggest a prolonged preclinical phase of AD in which A$\beta$ deposition reaches our threshold of positivity at 17{\textperiodcentered}0 (95% CI 14{\textperiodcentered}9-19{\textperiodcentered}9) years, hippocampal atrophy at 4{\textperiodcentered}2 (3{\textperiodcentered}6-5{\textperiodcentered}1) years, and memory impairment at 3{\textperiodcentered}3 (2{\textperiodcentered}5-4{\textperiodcentered}5) years before the onset of dementia (clinical dementia rating score 1).

abstract = {The NADPH-diaphorase histochemical technique provides a simple and robust method to stain select populations of neurons throughout the brain. We have recently identified the enzyme responsible for this histochemical reaction to be nitric oxide synthase. This enzyme is responsible for the calcium-dependent synthesis of nitric oxide from arginine. Nitric oxide acts as a novel neurat messenger by stimulating soluble guanylyl cyclase thereby increasing the levels of cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate in target cells. Thus the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical method allows the direct visualization of the neurons which use this novel signal transduction pathway. We now describe the detailed distribution of this enzyme in the rat brain. Our results suggest a widespread role for the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate system in the nervous system. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The progression of parkinsonian pathology and clinical phenotype has been broadly demonstrated to follow a specific pattern, most notably described by Braak and colleagues. In more recent times it has been hypothesized that $\alpha$syn itself may be a critical factor in mediating transmission of disease pathology from one brain area to another. Here we investigate the growing body of evidence demonstrating the ability of $\alpha$syn to spread transcellularly and induce pathological aggregation affecting neurons by permissive templating and provide a critical analysis of some irregularities in the hypothesis that the progression of PD pathology may be mediated by such a prion-like process. Finally we discuss some key questions that remain unanswered which are vital to determining the potential contribution of a prion-like process to the pathogenesis of PD.},

abstract = {The relationship between senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the main pathologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease, is not completely understood. We addressed this issue examining the type and amount of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) associated with the soluble and insoluble tissue fractions in the frontal cortex of 8 cases with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism caused by mutations of the Tau gene (FTDP-17), in which the intracellular accumulation of polymerised tau is definitely the primary cause of neurodegeneration. As control, we examined 7 cases with frontotemporal dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) as well as 8 pathologically normal subjects. In all cases the presence of Abeta deposits was ruled out using immunocytochemistry on sections adjacent to those used for biochemical analysis. ELISA analysis showed a 2.7 and 2.1 fold (p < 0.01) increase of soluble Abeta42 and Abeta40 in FTDP-17, compared to normal and DLDH brains, both of which had comparable levels of Abeta species. Furthermore, the immunoreactivity of the intracellular Abeta42 was significantly increased in cortical neurons of subjects affected with FTDP-17. The results demonstrate that the aggregation of tau protein produces an accumulation of Abeta, which, however, does not reach the critical concentration needed for Abetaplaques formation.},

abstract = {Tau is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and animal models have suggested that tau spreads from cell to cell through neuronal connections, facilitated by $\beta$ -amyloid (A $\beta$ ). We test this hypothesis in humans using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate tau spread, and compare these simulations to observed patterns measured using tau-PET in 312 individuals along Alzheimer's disease continuum. Up to 70% of the variance in the overall spatial pattern of tau can be explained by our model. Surprisingly, the ESM predicts the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether brain A $\beta$ is present, but regions with greater A $\beta$ burden show greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of A $\beta$ in accelerating tau spread. Altogether, our results provide evidence in humans that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain A $\beta$ .},

Here, we demonstrate that preformed fibrils generated from full-length and truncated recombinant $\alpha$-syn enter primary neurons, probably by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis, and promote recruitment of soluble endogenous $\alpha$-syn into insoluble PD-like LBs and LNs. Remarkably, endogenous $\alpha$-syn was sufficient for formation of these aggregates, and overexpression of wild-type or mutant $\alpha$-syn was not required. LN-like pathology first developed in axons and propagated to form LB-like inclusions in perikarya. Accumulation of pathologic $\alpha$-syn led to selective decreases in synaptic proteins, progressive impairments in neuronal excitability and connectivity, and, eventually, neuron death. Thus, our data contribute important insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of PD-like $\alpha$-syn inclusions and their impact on neuronal functions, and they provide a model for discovering therapeutics targeting pathologic $\alpha$-syn-mediated neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {This study compared sensitivity of FDG-PET, MR morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived fractional anisotropy (FA) measures to diagnosis and memory function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients (n=44) and normal controls (NC, n=22) underwent FDG-PET and MRI scanning yielding measures of metabolism, morphometry and FA in nine temporal and parietal areas affected by Alzheimer's disease and involved in the episodic memory network. Patients also underwent memory testing (RAVLT). Logistic regression analysis yielded 100% diagnostic accuracy when all methods and ROIs were combined, but none of the variables then served as unique predictors. Within separate ROIs, diagnostic accuracy for the methods combined ranged from 65.6% (parahippocampal gyrus) to 73.4 (inferior parietal cortex). Morphometry predicted diagnostic group for most ROIs. PET and FA did not uniquely predict group, but a trend was seen for the precuneus metabolism. For the MCI group, stepwise regression analyses predicting memory scores were performed with the same methods and ROIs. Hippocampal volume and FA of the retrosplenial WM predicted learning, and hippocampal metabolism and parahippocampal cortical thickness predicted 5 minute recall. No variable predicted 30 minute recall independently of learning. In conclusion, higher diagnostic accuracy was achieved when multiple methods and ROIs were combined, but morphometry showed superior diagnostic sensitivity. Metabolism, morphometry and FA all uniquely explained memory performance, making a multi-modal approach superior. Memory variation in MCI is likely related to conversion risk, and the results indicate potential for improved predictive power by the use of multimodal imaging.},

abstract = {A key commonality of most age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in the brain. Except for the prionoses, the initiation and propagation of these proteopathies in vivo remains poorly understood. In a previous study, we found that the deposition of the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta can be induced by injection of dilute extracts of Alzheimeric neocortex into the brains of Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing the human beta-amyloid precursor protein. The present study was undertaken to assess the pathology after long-term (12 months) incubation, and to clarify the distinctive anatomical distribution of seeded Abeta-immunoreactivity. All mice were injected at 3 months of age; 5 months later, as expected, Abeta deposits were concentrated mostly in the injected hemisphere. After 12 months, abundant, transgene-derived Abeta deposits were present bilaterally in the forebrain, but plaque load was still clearly greater in the extract-injected hemisphere. There was also evidence of tau hyperphosphorylation in axons of the corpus callosum that had been injured by the injection, most prominently in transgenic mice, but also, to a lesser degree, in non-transgenic mice. Five months following injection of AD-extract, an isolated cluster of Abeta-immunoreactive microglia was sometimes evident in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex; the strong innervation of the hippocampus by entorhinal cortical neurons suggests the possible spread of seeded pathology from the injection site via neuronal transport mechanisms. Finally, using India Ink to map the local dispersion of injectate, we found that Abeta induction is especially potent in places where the injectate is sequestered. The AD-seeding model can illuminate the emergence and spread of cerebral beta-amyloidosis and tau hyperphosphorylation, and thus could enhance our understanding of AD and its pathogenic commonalties with other cerebral proteopathies.},

abstract = {Most age-associated neurodegenerative diseases involve the aggregation of specific proteins within the nervous system. In Alzheimer disease, the insidious pathogenic process begins many years before the symptoms emerge, and the lesions that characterize the disease—senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles—ramify systematically through the brain. We review evidence that the -amyloid and tau proteins, which aggregate to form senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, are induced to misfold and self-assemble by a process of templated conformational change that amplifies a toxic species. Recent data also indicate that the spread of these lesions from one site to another is mediated by the cellular uptake, transport, and release of endogenous seeds formed by the cognate proteins. This simple pathogenic principle suggests that the formation, trafficking, and metabolism of pathogenic protein seeds are promising therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

By affirming markers of abnormal A$\beta$ and tau proteins as the essential pathobiological signature of Alzheimer's disease, the Framework tacitly reinforces the amyloid (A$\beta$) cascade as the leading theory of Alzheimer pathogenesis. In light of recent evidence that the cascade is driven by the misfolding and templated aggregation of A$\beta$ and tau, we believe that an empirically grounded Standard Model of Alzheimer's pathogenesis is within reach. A Standard Model can clarify and consolidate existing information, contextualize risk factors and the complex disease phenotype, identify testable hypotheses for future research, and pave the most direct path to effective prevention and treatment.},

abstract = {The prion paradigm has emerged as a unifying molecular principle for the pathogenesis of many age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This paradigm holds that a fundamental cause of specific disorders is the misfolding and seeded aggregation of certain proteins. The concept arose from the discovery that devastating brain diseases called spongiform encephalopathies are transmissible to new hosts by agents consisting solely of a misfolded protein, now known as the prion protein. Accordingly, “prion” was defined as a “proteinaceous infectious particle.” As the concept has expanded to include other diseases, many of which are not infectious by any conventional definition, the designation of prions as infectious agents has become problematic. We propose to define prions as “proteinaceous nucleating particles” to highlight the molecular action of the agents, lessen unwarranted apprehension about the transmissibility of noninfectious proteopathies, and promote the wider acceptance of this revolutionary paradigm by the biomedical community.},

abstract = {Although extensive data support a central pathogenic role for amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid hypothesis remains controversial, in part because a specific neurotoxic species of Abeta and the nature of its effects on synaptic function have not been defined in vivo. Here we report that natural oligomers of human Abeta are formed soon after generation of the peptide within specific intracellular vesicles and are subsequently secreted from the cell. Cerebral microinjection of cell medium containing these oligomers and abundant Abeta monomers but no amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rats in vivo. Immunodepletion from the medium of all Abeta species completely abrogated this effect. Pretreatment of the medium with insulin-degrading enzyme, which degrades Abeta monomers but not oligomers, did not prevent the inhibition of LTP. Therefore, Abeta oligomers, in the absence of monomers and amyloid fibrils, disrupted synaptic plasticity in vivo at concentrations found in human brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented oligomer formation at doses that allowed appreciable monomer production, and such medium no longer disrupted LTP, indicating that synaptotoxic Abeta oligomers can be targeted therapeutically.},

abstract = {Evidence has been mounting for an involvement of the prion protein (PrP) in a molecular pathway assumed to play a critical role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease. A currently popular model sees oligomeric amyloid $\beta$ (oA$\beta$) peptides bind directly to PrP to emanate a signal that causes activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Fyn, an essential player in a cascade of events that ultimately leads to NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and hyper-phosphorylation of tau. The model does not reveal, however, how extracellular binding of oA$\beta$ to PrP is communicated across the plasma membrane barrier to affect activation of Fyn. A scenario whereby PrP may adapt a transmembrane topology to affect Fyn activation in the absence of additional partners is currently not supported by evidence. A survey of known candidate PrP interactors leads to a small number of molecules that are known to acquire a transmembrane topology and understood to contribute to Fyn activation. Because multiple signaling pathways converge onto Fyn, a realistic model needs to take into account a reality of Fyn acting as a hub that integrates signals from multiple inhibitory and activating effectors. To clarify the role of PrP in oA$\beta$-dependent excitotoxicity, future studies may need to incorporate experimental designs that can probe the contributions of Fyn modulator pathways and rely on analogous readouts, rather than threshold effects, known to underlie excitotoxic signaling.},

In particular, the anatomic embedding of the edges of the cerebral graph have been postulated to elucidate the relative importance of white matter tracts to the overall network connectivity, explaining the varying effects of localized white matter pathology on cognition and behavior. Here, we demonstrate the use of a linear diffusion model to quantify the impact of these perturbations on brain connectivity. We show that the eigenmodes governing the dynamics of this model are strongly conserved between healthy subjects regardless of cortical and sub-cortical parcellations, but show significant, interpretable deviations in improperly developed brains. More specifically, we investigated the effect of agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), one of the most common brain malformations to identify differences in the effect of virtual corpus callosotomies and the neurodevelopmental disorder itself. These findings, including the strong correspondence between regions of highest importance from graph eigenmodes of network diffusion and nexus regions of white matter from edge density imaging, show converging evidence toward understanding the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. However, despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive. METHODS To elucidate molecular systems associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple measures of the severity of neuropathological lesions associated with AD (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression networks. We rank-ordered 44,692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits. RESULTS The neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and unlikely to be mere bystander result of degeneration; several modules were closely linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive compromise and development of the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD.},

In murine models of AD, TREM2 deficiency prevents microglial clustering around A$\beta$ deposits.

Using parabiosis, we found that amyloid-associated myeloid cells derive from brain-resident microglia rather than from recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes. To determine the impact of TREM2 deficiency on A$\beta$ accumulation, we examined A$\beta$ plaques in the 5XFAD model of AD at the onset of A$\beta$-related pathology. At this early time point, A$\beta$ accumulation was similar in TREM2-deficient and -sufficient 5XFAD mice. However, in the absence of TREM2, A$\beta$ plaques were not fully enclosed by microglia; they were more diffuse, less dense, and were associated with significantly greater neuritic damage. Thus, TREM2 protects from AD by enabling microglia to surround and alter A$\beta$ plaque structure, thereby limiting neuritic damage. </p>},

abstract = {Background: Tau pathology in AD spreads in a hierarchical pattern, whereby it first appears in the entorhinal cortex, then spreads to the hippocampus and later to the surrounding areas. Based on this sequential appearance, AD can be classified into six stages ("Braak stages"). The mechanisms and agents underlying the progression of Tau pathology are a matter of debate. Emerging evidence indicates that the propagation of Tau pathology may be due to the transmission of Tau protein, but the underlying pathways and Tau species are not well understood. In this study we investigated the question of Tau spreading via small extracellular vesicles called exosomes. Methods: Exosomes from different sources were analyzed by biochemical methods and electron microscopy (EM) and cryo-EM. Microfluidic devices that allow the culture of cell populations in different compartments were used to investigate the spreading of Tau. Results: We show that Tau protein is released by cultured primary neurons or by N2a cells overexpressing different Tau constructs via exosomes. Neuron-derived exosomal Tau is hypo-phosphorylated, compared with cytosolic Tau. Depolarization of neurons promotes release of Tau-containing exosomes, highlighting the importance of neuronal activity. Using microfluidic devices we show that exosomes mediate trans-neuronal transfer of Tau depending on synaptic connectivity. Tau spreading is achieved by direct transmission of exosomes between neurons. In organotypic hippocampal slices, Tau-containing exosomes in conditioned medium are taken up by neurons and microglia, not astrocytes. In N2a cells, Tau assemblies are released via exosomes. They can induce inclusions of other Tau molecules in N2a cells expressing mutant human Tau. We also studied exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid in AD and control subjects containing monomeric and oligomeric Tau. Split-luciferase complementation reveals that exosomes from CSF can promote Tau aggregation in cultured cells. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that exosomes contribute to trans-synaptic Tau transmission, and thus offer new approches to control the spreading of pathology in AD and other tauopathies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most common of the protein misfolding ("amyloid") diseases. The deposits in the brains of afflicted patients contain as a major fraction an aggregated insoluble form of the so-called amyloid $\beta$-peptides (A$\beta$ peptides): fragments of the amyloid precursor protein of 39-43 residues in length. This review focuses on biophysical studies of the A$\beta$ peptides: that is, of the aggregation pathways and intermediates observed during aggregation, of the molecular structures observed along these pathways, and of the interactions of A$\beta$ with Cu and Zn ions and with small molecules that modify the aggregation pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on studies based on high-resolution and solid-state NMR methods. Theoretical studies relating to the interactions are also included. An emerging picture is that of A$\beta$ peptides in aqueous solution undergoing hydrophobic collapse together with identical partners. There then follows a relatively slow process leading to more ordered secondary and tertiary (quaternary) structures in the growing aggregates. These aggregates eventually assemble into elongated fibrils visible by electron microscopy. Small molecules or metal ions that interfere with the aggregation processes give rise to a variety of aggregation products that may be studied in vitro and considered in relation to observations in cell cultures or in vivo. Although the heterogeneous nature of the processes makes detailed structural studies difficult, knowledge and understanding of the underlying physical chemistry might provide a basis for future therapeutic strategies against the disease. A final part of the review deals with the interactions that may occur between the A$\beta$ peptides and the prion protein, where the latter is involved in other protein misfolding diseases.},

abstract = {Despite being the subject of intense study, the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease still remains unclear. In recent years, however, there has been increasing evidence to support a role for genetic factors in its cause. This has come from twin and family studies, the mapping and cloning of PARK genes that are associated with the development of PD, and analysis of potential susceptibility genes. There is also evidence indicating that environmental factors may play a role in the disease process. It is likely that for most cases, there is a complex interplay between these genetic and environmental influences in the causation of Parkinson's disease. This article reviews the evidence in support of genetic and environmental factors in the cause of PD.},

abstract = {Neural networks provide candidate substrates for the spread of proteinopathies causing neurodegeneration, and emerging data suggest that macroscopic signatures of network disintegration differentiate diseases. However, how do protein abnormalities produce network signatures? The answer may lie with 'molecular nexopathies': specific, coherent conjunctions of pathogenic protein and intrinsic network characteristics that define network signatures of neurodegenerative pathologies. Key features of the paradigm that we propose here include differential intrinsic network vulnerability to propagating protein abnormalities, in part reflecting developmental structural and functional factors; differential vulnerability of neural connection types (e.g., clustered versus distributed connections) to particular pathogenic proteins; and differential impact of molecular effects (e.g., toxic-gain-of-function versus loss-of-function) on gradients of network damage. The paradigm has implications for understanding and predicting neurodegenerative disease biology. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Prion disease is characterized by a chain reaction in which infectious misfolded proteins force native proteins into a similar pathogenic structure. Recent studies have reinforced the hypothesis that the prion paradigm–the templated growth and spreading of misfolded proteins–could help explain the progression of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. However, our current understanding of prion-like growth and spreading is rather empirical. Here we show that a physics-based reaction-diffusion model can explain the growth and spreading of misfolded protein in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To characterize the progression of misfolded proteins across the brain, we combine the classical Fisher–Kolmogorov equation for population dynamics with an anisotropic diffusion model and simulate misfolding across a sagittal section and across the entire brain. In a systematic sensitivity analysis, we probe the role of the individual model parameters and show that the misfolded protein concentration is sensitive to the coefficients of growth, extracellular diffusion, and axonal transport, to the axonal fiber orientation, and to the initial seeding region. Our model correctly predicts amyloid-$\beta$ deposits and tau inclusions in Alzheimer's disease, $\alpha$-synuclein inclusions in Parkinson's disease, and TDP-43 inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and displays excellent agreement with the histological patterns in diseased human brains. When integrated across the brain, our concentration profiles result in biomarker curves that display a striking similarity with the sigmoid shape and qualitative timeline of clinical biomarker models. Our results suggest that misfolded proteins in various neurodegenerative disorders grow and spread according to a universal law that follows the basic physical principles of nonlinear reaction and anisotropic diffusion. Our findings substantiate the notion of a common underlying principle for the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders, the prion paradigm. A more quantitative understanding of the growth and spreading of misfolded amyloid-$\beta$ tau, $\alpha$-synuclein, and TDP-43 would allow us to establish a prognostic timeframe of disease progression. This could have important clinical implications, ranging from more accurate estimates of the socioeconomic burden of neurodegeneration to a more informed design of clinical trials and pharmacological intervention.},

The lesions created by aggregates of these toxic proteins further lead to cell death and accelerated tissue atrophy. A striking feature of some of these diseases is their characteristic pattern and evolution, leading to well-codified disease stages visible to neuropathology and associated with various cognitive deficits and pathologies. Here, we simulate the anisotropic propagation and accumulation of toxic proteins in full brain geometry. We show that the same model with different initial seeding zones reproduces the characteristic evolution of different prionlike diseases. We also recover the expected evolution of the total toxic protein load. Finally, we couple our transport model to a mechanical atrophy model to obtain the typical degeneration patterns found in neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by \beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, \beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

Use of these capacity measures is motivated in part by exploration of the effects of atrophy on a computational model of a basic hippocampal circuit. We use this model to suggest that capacity may be a more sensitive indicator of undelying atrophy than speed of processing, and test this hypothesis by adapting a standard behavioral measure of memory (the free and cued selective reminding test, FCSRT) to allow for the collection of cued recall latencies. Participants were drawn from five groups: college-aged, middle-aged, healthy elderly, those with a diagnosis of MCI, and a sample of MCI control participants. The measure of capacity is shown to offer increased classificatory sensitivity relative to the standard behavioral measures, and is also shown to be the behavioral measure that correlated most strongly with hippocampal volume.},

abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous networks that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain. However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources. We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn (www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data. Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global signal. The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity. We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented fcMRI measures. The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures. {\textcopyright} 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, are one of the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). We aimed to determine whether patterns of gray matter atrophy from antemortem MRI correlate with Braak staging of NFT pathology. METHODS: Eighty-three subjects with Braak stage III through VI, a pathologic diagnosis of low- to high-probability AD, and MRI within 4 years of death were identified. Voxel-based morphometry assessed gray matter atrophy in each Braak stage compared with 20 pathologic control subjects (Braak stages 0 through II). RESULTS: In pairwise comparisons with Braak stages 0 through II, a graded response was observed across Braak stages V and VI, with more severe and widespread loss identified at Braak stage VI. No regions of loss were identified in Braak stage III or IV compared with Braak stages 0 through II. The lack of findings in Braak stages III and IV could be because Braak stage is based on the presence of any NFT pathology regardless of severity. Actual NFT burden may vary by Braak stage. Therefore, tau burden was assessed in subjects with Braak stages 0 through IV. Those with high tau burden showed greater gray matter loss in medial and lateral temporal lobes than those with low tau burden. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of gray matter loss are associated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, specifically with NFT burden at Braak stages III and IV and with Braak stage itself at higher stages. This validates three-dimensional patterns of atrophy on MRI as an approximate in vivo surrogate indicator of the full brain topographic representation of the neurodegenerative aspect of Alzheimer disease pathology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Three subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been pathologically defined on the basis of the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles: typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD, and limbic-predominant AD. Compared with typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD has more neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex and fewer in the hippocampus, whereas the opposite pattern is seen in limbic-predominant AD. We aimed to determine whether MRI patterns of atrophy differ between these subtypes and whether structural neuroimaging could be a useful predictor of pathological subtype at autopsy. METHODS We identified patients who had been followed up in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN, USA) or in the Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (Rochester, MN, USA) between 1992 and 2005. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have had dementia, AD pathology at autopsy (Braak stage ≥IV and intermediate to high probability of AD), and an ante-mortem MRI. Cases were assigned to one of three pathological subtypes--hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant, and typical AD--on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle counts in hippocampus and cortex and ratio of hippocampal to cortical burden, without reference to neuronal loss. Voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation were used to compare patterns of grey matter loss between groups and with age-matched control individuals. Neuroimaging was obtained at the time of first presentation. To summarise pair-wise group differences, we report the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). FINDINGS Of 177 eligible patients, 125 (71%) were classified as having typical AD, 33 (19%) as having limbic-predominant AD, and 19 (11%) as having hippocampal-sparing AD. Most patients with typical (98 [78%]) and limbic-predominant AD (31 [94%]) initially presented with an amnestic syndrome, but fewer patients with hippocampal-sparing AD (eight [42%]) did. The most severe medial temporal atrophy was recorded in patients with limbic-predominant AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then those with hippocampal-sparing AD. Conversely, the most severe cortical atrophy was noted in patients with hippocampal-sparing AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then limbic-predominant AD. The ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes allowed the best discrimination between subtypes (p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001; three-way AUROC 0{\textperiodcentered}52 [95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}47-0{\textperiodcentered}52]; ratio of AUROC to chance classification 3{\textperiodcentered}1 [2{\textperiodcentered}8-3{\textperiodcentered}1]). Patients with typical AD and non-amnesic initial presentation had a significantly higher ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes (median 0{\textperiodcentered}045 [IQR 0{\textperiodcentered}035-0{\textperiodcentered}056]) than did those with an amnesic presentation (0{\textperiodcentered}041 [0{\textperiodcentered}031-0{\textperiodcentered}057]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}001). INTERPRETATION Patterns of atrophy on MRI differ across the pathological subtypes of AD. MRI regional volumetric analysis can reliably track the distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and can predict pathological subtype of AD at autopsy.

abstract = {Disease-modifying therapies are being developed to target tau pathology, and should, therefore, be tested in primary tauopathies. We propose that progressive apraxia of speech should be considered one such target group. In this study, we investigate potential neuroimaging and clinical outcome measures for progressive apraxia of speech and determine sample size estimates for clinical trials. We prospectively recruited 24 patients with progressive apraxia of speech who underwent two serial MRI with an interval of approximately 2 years. Detailed speech and language assessments included the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale and Motor Speech Disorders severity scale. Rates of ventricular expansion and rates of whole brain, striatal and midbrain atrophy were calculated. Atrophy rates across 38 cortical regions were also calculated and the regions that best differentiated patients from controls were selected. Sample size estimates required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials were calculated. The smallest sample size estimates were obtained with rates of atrophy of the precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area, with both measures requiring less than 50 subjects per arm to detect a 25% treatment effect with 80% power. These measures outperformed the other regional and global MRI measures and the clinical scales. Regional rates of cortical atrophy, therefore, provide the best outcome measures in progressive apraxia of speech. The small sample size estimates demonstrate feasibility for including progressive apraxia of speech in future clinical treatment trials targeting tau.},

abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are both common degenerative dementias in the under 65 age group. Although clinical criteria have been defined for both diseases, there is considerable overlap in clinical features, and hence, diagnosis still can be very difficult particularly in the early stages of the disease. As a result, there has been increasing interest in using magnetic resonance imaging to better characterize these diseases and to aid in diagnosis. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is an automated technique that assesses patterns of regional gray matter atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging between 2 groups of subjects. It is unbiased in that it looks throughout the whole brain and does not require any a priori assumptions concerning which structures to assess, giving it a significant advantage over traditional region of interest-based methods. Voxel-based morphometry has been widely used to assess patterns of regional atrophy in subjects with AD and FTLD. These studies have demonstrated specific patterns of regional loss in both diseases, compared the 2 diseases to look for differences that could be diagnostically useful, and have correlated regions of gray matter loss to cognitive and behavioral deficits in these subjects. This article will review the findings of these studies and discuss the role of VBM in these neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare patterns of cerebral atrophy on MRI, and neurochemistry on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and typical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess grey matter atrophy in 38 patients with PCA, 38 patients with typical AD, and 38 controls. Clinical data was assessed in all PCA patients. Single voxel 1H MRS located in the posterior cingulate was analyzed in a subset of patients with PCA, typical AD, and control subjects. PCA showed a pattern of atrophy affecting occipital, parietal and posterior temporal lobes, compared to controls. The pattern was bilateral, but more severe on the right. Patients with PCA showed greater atrophy in the right visual association cortex than patients with typical AD, whereas those with AD showed greater atrophy in the left hippocampus than those with PCA. 1H MRS suggested loss of neuronal integrity and glial activation in subjects with PCA and typical AD. The differing patterns of atrophy on MRI suggest that PCA should be considered a distinct entity from typical AD. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by changes in personality and behaviour. It is typically associated with frontal lobe atrophy, although patterns of atrophy are heterogeneous. The objective of this study was to examine case-by-case variability in patterns of grey matter atrophy in subjects with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia and to investigate whether behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia can be divided into distinct anatomical subtypes. Sixty-six subjects that fulfilled clinical criteria for a diagnosis of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia with a volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scan were identified. Grey matter volumes were obtained for 26 regions of interest, covering frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, striatum, insula and supplemental motor area, using the automated anatomical labelling atlas. Regional volumes were divided by total grey matter volume. A hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis using Ward's clustering linkage method was performed to cluster the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia subjects into different anatomical clusters. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess patterns of grey matter loss in each identified cluster of subjects compared to an age and gender-matched control group at P < 0.05 (family-wise error corrected). We identified four potentially useful clusters with distinct patterns of grey matter loss, which we posit represent anatomical subtypes of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. Two of these subtypes were associated with temporal lobe volume loss, with one subtype showing loss restricted to temporal lobe regions (temporal-dominant subtype) and the other showing grey matter loss in the temporal lobes as well as frontal and parietal lobes (temporofrontoparietal subtype). Another two subtypes were characterized by a large amount of frontal lobe volume loss, with one subtype showing grey matter loss in the frontal lobes as well as loss of the temporal lobes (frontotemporal subtype) and the other subtype showing loss relatively restricted to the frontal lobes (frontal-dominant subtype). These four subtypes differed on clinical measures of executive function, episodic memory and confrontation naming. There were also associations between the four subtypes and genetic or pathological diagnoses which were obtained in 48% of the cohort. The clusters did not differ in behavioural severity as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; supporting the original classification of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia in these subjects. Our findings suggest behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia can therefore be subdivided into four different anatomical subtypes.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly the amnestic subtype (aMCI), is considered as a transitional stage between normal aging and a diagnosis of clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aMCI construct is particularly useful as it provides an opportunity to assess a clinical stage which in most subjects represents prodromal AD. The aim of this study was to assess the progression of cerebral atrophy over multiple serial MRI during the period from aMCI to progression to AD. Thirty-three subjects were selected that fulfilled clinical criteria for aMCI and had three serial MRI scans: the first scan approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of AD, the second scan approximately 1 year before, and the third scan at the time of the diagnosis of AD. A group of 33 healthy controls were age and gender-matched to the study cohort. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of grey matter atrophy in the aMCI subjects at each time-point compared to the control group. Customized templates and prior probability maps were used to avoid normalization and segmentation bias. The pattern of grey matter loss in the aMCI subject scans that were 3 years before the diagnosis of AD was focused primarily on the medial temporal lobes, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, with some additional involvement of the fusiform gyrus, compared to controls. The extent and magnitude of the cerebral atrophy further progressed by the time the subjects were 1 year before the diagnosis of AD. At this point atrophy in the temporal lobes spread to include the middle temporal gyrus, and extended into more posterior regions of the temporal lobe to include the entire extent of the hippocampus. The parietal lobe also started to become involved. By the time the subjects had progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD the pattern of grey matter atrophy had become still more widespread with more severe involvement of the medial temporal lobes and the temporoparietal association cortices and, for the first time, substantial involvement of the frontal lobes. This pattern of progression fits well with the Braak and Braak neurofibrillary pathological staging scheme in AD. It suggests that the earliest changes occur in the anterior medial temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus, and that these changes occur at least 3 years before progression to the diagnosis of AD. These results also suggest that 3D patterns of grey matter atrophy may help to predict the time to the first diagnosis of AD in subjects with aMCI.},

abstract = {A major recent discovery was the identification of an expansion of a non-coding GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the C9ORF72 gene in patients with frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutations in two other genes are known to account for familial frontotemporal dementia: microtubule-associated protein tau and progranulin. Although imaging features have been previously reported in subjects with mutations in tau and progranulin, no imaging features have been published in C9ORF72. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether there are differences in atrophy patterns across these mutations, and whether regional differences could help differentiate C9ORF72 from the other two mutations at the single-subject level. We aimed to determine the regional pattern of brain atrophy associated with the C9ORF72 gene mutation, and to determine which regions best differentiate C9ORF72 from subjects with mutations in tau and progranulin, and from sporadic frontotemporal dementia. A total of 76 subjects, including 56 with a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and a mutation in one of these genes (19 with C9ORF72 mutations, 25 with tau mutations and 12 with progranulin mutations) and 20 sporadic subjects with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (including 50% with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), with magnetic resonance imaging were included in this study. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess and compare patterns of grey matter atrophy. Atlas-based parcellation was performed utilizing the automated anatomical labelling atlas and Statistical Parametric Mapping software to compute volumes of 37 regions of interest. Hemispheric asymmetry was calculated. Penalized multinomial logistic regression was utilized to create a prediction model to discriminate among groups using regional volumes and asymmetry score. Principal component analysis assessed for variance within groups. C9ORF72 was associated with symmetric atrophy predominantly involving dorsolateral, medial and orbitofrontal lobes, with additional loss in anterior temporal lobes, parietal lobes, occipital lobes and cerebellum. In contrast, striking anteromedial temporal atrophy was associated with tau mutations and temporoparietal atrophy was associated with progranulin mutations. The sporadic group was associated with frontal and anterior temporal atrophy. A conservative penalized multinomial logistic regression model identified 14 variables that could accurately classify subjects, including frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and cerebellum volume. The principal component analysis revealed similar degrees of heterogeneity within all disease groups. Patterns of atrophy therefore differed across subjects with C9ORF72, tau and progranulin mutations and sporadic frontotemporal dementia. Our analysis suggested that imaging has the potential to be useful to help differentiate C9ORF72 from these other groups at the single-subject level.},

Two receptors bind ApoE complexes, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP). In normal brain, anti-LRP antibodies strongly stained neurons and lightly stained astrocytes; anti-LDL receptor antibodies stained only the neuropil and astrocytes. In Alzheimer's disease, SPs and reactive astrocytes were also strongly LRP immunoreactive. Colocalization of ApoE and LRP to SPs implies that these molecules may be involved in metabolism of components of SPs.},

abstract = {Clinical syndromes associated with progressive supranuclear palsy-tau pathology now include progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P), in addition to classic Richardson's syndrome (RS) and pure akinesia with gait freezing (PAGF). Although pathological heterogeneity of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) has also been established, attempts to correlate this with clinical findings have only rarely provided conclusive results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether regional variations in the types of tau lesions or differences in overall tau load may explain the clinical differences between the RS, PSP-P and PAGF. Quantitative tau pathology assessment was performed in 17 brain regions in 42 cases of pathologically diagnosed PSP (22 RS, 14 PSP-P and 6 PAGF). Neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes, coiled bodies and thread pathology were quantitated and a grading system was developed separately for each region. Using these grades the overall tau load was calculated in each case. To establish a simplified system for grading the severity of tau pathology, all data were explored to identify the minimum number of regions that satisfactorily summarized the overall tau severity. The subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and globus pallidus were consistently the regions most severely affected by tau pathology. The mean severity in all regions of the RS group was higher than in PSP-P and PAGF, and the overall tau load was significantly higher in RS than in PSP-P (P = 0.002). Using only the grade of coiled body + thread lesions in the substantia nigra, caudate and dentate nucleus, a reliable and repeatable 12-tiered grading system was established (PSP-tau score: 0, mild tau pathology, restricted distribution; >7, severe, widespread tau pathology). PSP-tau score was negatively correlated with disease duration (Spearman's rho −0.36, P = 0.028) and time from disease onset to first fall (Spearman's rho −0.49, P = 0.003). The PSP-tau score in PSP-P (median 3, range 0–5) was significantly lower than in RS (median 5, range 2–10, Mann–Whitney U, P < 0.001). The two cases carrying the tau-H2 protective allele had the two lowest PSP-tau scores. We have identified significant pathological differences between the major clinical syndromes associated with PSP-tau pathology and the restricted, mild tau pathology in PSP-P supports its clinical distinction from RS. The grading system we have developed provides an easy-to-use and sensitive tool for the morphological assessment of PSP-tau pathology and allows for consideration of the clinical diversity that is known to occur in PSP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measures such as T2 lesion load correlate poorly with disability in multiple sclerosis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain can provide unique information regarding the orientation and integrity of white matter tracts in vivo. OBJECTIVE: To use this information to map the pyramidal tracts of patients with multiple sclerosis, investigate the relation between burden of disease in the tracts and disability, and compare this with more global magnetic resonance estimates of disease burden. METHODS: 25 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy volunteers were studied with DTI. An algorithm was used that automatically produced anatomically plausible maps of white matter tracts. The integrity of the pyramidal tracts was assessed using relative anisotropy and a novel measure (L(t)) derived from the compounded relative anisotropy along the tracts. The methods were compared with both traditional and more recent techniques for measuring disease burden in multiple sclerosis (T2 lesion load and "whole brain" diffusion histograms). RESULTS: Relative anisotropy and L(t) were significantly lower in patients than controls (p < 0.05). Pyramidal tract L(t) in the patients correlated significantly with both expanded disability status scale (r = -0.48, p < 0.05), and to a greater degree, the pyramidal Kurtzke functional system score (KFS-p) (r = -0.75, p < 0.0001). T2 lesion load and diffusion histogram parameters did not correlate with disability. CONCLUSIONS: Tract mapping using DTI is feasible and may increase the specificity of MRI in multiple sclerosis by matching appropriate tracts with specific clinical scoring systems. These techniques may be applicable to a wide range of neurological conditions.},

abstract = {—Many practical methods for finding maximally sparse coefficient expansions involve solving a regression problem using a particular class of concave penalty functions. From a Bayesian per-spective, this process is equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using a sparsity-inducing prior distribution (Type I esti-mation). Using variational techniques, this distribution can always be conveniently expressed as a maximization over scaled Gaussian distributions modulated by a set of latent variables. Alternative Bayesian algorithms, which operate in latent variable space lever-aging this variational representation, lead to sparse estimators re-flecting posterior information beyond the mode (Type II estima-tion). Currently, it is unclear how the underlying cost functions of Type I and Type II relate, nor what relevant theoretical proper-ties exist, especially with regard to Type II. Herein a common set of auxiliary functions is used to conveniently express both Type I and Type II cost functions in either coefficient or latent variable space facilitating direct comparisons. In coefficient space, the anal-ysis reveals that Type II is exactly equivalent to performing stan-dard MAP estimation using a particular class of dictionary-and noise-dependent, nonfactorial coefficient priors. One prior (at least) from this class maintains several desirable advantages over all pos-sible Type I methods and utilizes a novel, nonconvex approximation to th{\`{e}}0 norm with most, and in certain quantifiable conditions all, local minima smoothed away. Importantly, the global minimum is always left unaltered unlike standar 1 -norm relaxations. This en-sures that any appropriate descent method is guaranteed to locate the maximally sparse solution.

abstract = {Automatic relevance determination (ARD) and the closely-related sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework are effective tools for pruning large numbers of irrelevant features leading to a sparse explanatory subset. However, popular up-date rules used for ARD are either difficult to extend to more general problems of interest or are characterized by non-ideal convergence properties. Moreover, it re-mains unclear exactly how ARD relates to more traditional MAP estimation-based methods for learning sparse representations (e.g., the Lasso). This paper furnishes an alternative means of expressing the ARD cost function using auxiliary func-tions that naturally addresses both of these issues. First, the proposed reformu-lation of ARD can naturally be optimized by solving a series of re-weighted 1 problems. The result is an efficient, extensible algorithm that can be implemented using standard convex programming toolboxes and is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum (or saddle point). Secondly, the analysis reveals that ARD is exactly equivalent to performing standard MAP estimation in weight space using a particular feature-and noise-dependent, non-factorial weight prior. We then demonstrate that this implicit prior maintains several desirable advantages over conventional priors with respect to feature selection. Overall these results suggest alternative cost functions and update procedures for selecting features and promot-ing sparse solutions in a variety of general situations. In particular, the method-ology readily extends to handle problems such as non-negative sparse coding and covariance component estimation.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions. However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent A$\beta$ burden. Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that A$\beta$-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns. OBJECTIVE To examine relationships between A$\beta$ and non-A$\beta$ factors as well as neurodegeneration within AD regions in cognitively normal older adults. The study quantified neurodegenerative abnormalities using imaging biomarkers and examined cross-sectional relationships with A$\beta$ deposition; white matter lesions (WMLs), a marker of cerebrovascular disease; and cognitive functions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study in a community-based convenience sample of 72 cognitively normal older individuals (mean [SD] age, 74.9 [5.7] years; 48 women; mean [SD] 17.0 [1.9] years of education) of the Berkeley Aging Cohort. INTERVENTION: Each individual underwent a standardized neuropsychological test session, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scanning. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each individual, 3 AD-sensitive neurodegeneration biomarkers were measured: hippocampal volume, glucose metabolism, and gray matter thickness, the latter 2 sampled from cortical AD-affected regions. To quantify neurodegenerative abnormalities, each biomarker was age adjusted, dichotomized into a normal or abnormal status (using cutoff thresholds derived from an independent AD sample), and summarized into 0, 1, or more than 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker. Degree and topographic patterns of neurodegenerative abnormalities were assessed and their relationships with cognitive functions, WML volume, and A$\beta$ deposition (quantified using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography). RESULTS: Of our cognitively normal elderly individuals, 40% (n = 29) displayed at least 1 abnormal neurodegenerative biomarker, 26% (n = 19) of whom had no evidence of elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention. In those people who were classified as having abnormal cortical thickness, degree and topographic specificity of neurodegenerative abnormalities were similar to patients with AD. Accumulation of neurodegenerative abnormalities was related to poor memory and executive functions as well as larger WML volumes but not elevated Pittsburgh compound B retention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our study confirms that a substantial proportion of cognitively normal older adults harbor neurodegeneration, without A$\beta$ burden. Associations of neurodegenerative abnormalities with cerebrovascular disease and cognitive performance indicate that neurodegenerative pathology can emerge through non-A$\beta$ pathways within regions most affected by AD.},

abstract = {The present report deals with the projections from the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices to subcortical forebrain structures and the brainstem in the cat. By using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques, it could be demonstrated that the entire mediolateral extent of the parahippocampal cortex issues prominent projections to the dorsal and ventral striatum, the amygdala, and the claustrum. In addition, the entorhinal cortex sends projections to the septum and the diagonal band of Broca. Only the perirhinal cortex gives rise to a weak projection to the dorsolateral periaquaductal gray and the ventral pontine region. The major proportion of the subcortical projections originates in the perirhinal cortex and the lateral entorhinal cortex, whereas the medial entorhinal cortex has a much sparser output and sends no fibers to the amygdala. The subcortical projections from both the entorhinal cortex and the perirhinal cortex arise mostly from their deep layers. It was further found that these projections are topographically organized along the mediolateral axis of the parahippocampal cortex. This mediolateral axis is related to a ventrolateral to dorsomedial axis in the septum, a mediolateral axis in the amygdala and the ventral striatum, and a ventrodorsal coordinate in the dorsal striatum and the claustrum. A further topography was observed in the projections from the perirhinal cortex to the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. A rostrocaudal axis in the perirhinal cortex corresponds to a mediolateral axis in the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. The present observations are compared with data concerning the connectivity of the parahippocampal cortex with the hippocampal formation and other cortical structures. It is suggested that the parahippocampal cortex in the cat may be conceptualized as an interface between the hippocampal formation and several subcortical structures in the realm of the limbic and motor systems.},

In tauopathies, the protein tau misfolds, causing several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Here we created a panel of mammalian cell lines expressing a fragment of tau fused to yellow fluorescent protein. Each cell line selectively detects tau prions that are misfolded into self-propagating conformations; such cells permit identification of minute differences among tauopathies. For example, tau prions in AD and CTE are distinct from prions in other tauopathies such as Pick's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. These insights are likely to contribute to the development of future therapeutics.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies, the major components of which are filaments consisting of alpha-synuclein. Two recently identified point mutations in alpha-synuclein are the only known genetic causes of PD. alpha-Synuclein fibrils similar to the Lewy body filaments can be formed in vitro, and we have shown recently that both PD-linked mutations accelerate their formation. This study addresses the mechanism of alpha-synuclein aggregation: we show that (i) it is a nucleation-dependent process that can be seeded by aggregated alpha-synuclein functioning as nuclei, (ii) this fibril growth follows first-order kinetics with respect to alpha-synuclein concentration, and (iii) mutant alpha-synuclein can seed the aggregation of wild type alpha-synuclein, which leads us to predict that the Lewy bodies of familial PD patients with alpha-synuclein mutations will contain both, the mutant and the wild type protein. Finally (iv), we show that wild type and mutant forms of alpha-synuclein do not differ in their critical concentrations. These results suggest that differences in aggregation kinetics of alpha-synucleins cannot be explained by differences in solubility but are due to different nucleation rates. Consequently, alpha-synuclein nucleation may be the rate-limiting step for the formation of Lewy body alpha-synuclein fibrils in Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hypothetical model of dynamic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) describes high amyloid deposition and hypometabolism at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, it remains unknown whether brain amyloidosis and hypometabolism follow the same trajectories in MCI individuals. We used the concept of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) as defined by the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-Go in order to compare the biomarker profile between EMCI and LMCI. OBJECTIVES: To examine the global and voxel-based neocortical amyloid burden and metabolism among individuals who are cognitively normal (CN), as well as those with EMCI, LMCI and mild AD. METHODS: In the present study, 354 participants, including CN (n = 109), EMCI (n = 157), LMCI (n = 39) and AD (n = 49), were enrolled between September 2009 and November 2011 through ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. Brain amyloid load and metabolism were estimated using [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET, respectively. Uptake ratio images of [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]FDG were calculated by dividing the summed PET image by the median counts of the grey matter of the cerebellum and pons, respectively. Group differences of global [(18)F]AV45 and [(18)F]FDG were analyzed using ANOVA, while the voxel-based group differences were estimated using statistic parametric mapping (SPM). RESULTS: EMCI patients showed higher global [(18)F]AV45 retention compared to CN and lower uptake compared to LMCI. SPM detected higher [(18)F]AV45 uptake in EMCI compared to CN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, medial and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. EMCI showed lower [(18)F]AV45 retention than LMCI in the superior temporal, inferior parietal, as well as dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, bilaterally. Regarding to the global [(18)F]FDG, EMCI patients showed no significant difference from CN and a higher uptake ratio compared to LMCI. At the voxel level, EMCI showed higher metabolism in precuneus, hippocampus, entorhinal and inferior parietal cortices, as compared to LMCI. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that brain metabolism remains normal despite the presence of significant amyloid accumulation in EMCI. These results suggest a role for anti-amyloid interventions in EMCI aiming to delay or halt the deposition of amyloid and related metabolism impairment.},

abstract = {Atlas-based segmentation of MR brain images typically uses a single atlas (e.g., MNI Colin27) for region identification. Normal individual variations in human brain structures present a significant challenge for atlas selection. Previous researches mainly focused on how to create a specific template for different requirements (e.g., for a certain population). We address atlas selection with a different approach: instead of choosing a fixed brain atlas, we use a family of brain templates for atlas-based segmentation. For each subject and each region, the template selection method automatically chooses the 'best' template with the highest local registration accuracy, based on normalized mutual information. The region classification performances of the template selection method and the single template method were quantified by the overlap ratios (ORs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the manual tracings and the respective automated labeled results. Two groups of brain images and multiple regions of interest (ROIs), including the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and several subcortical structures, were tested for both methods. We found that the template selection method produced significantly higher ORs than did the single template method across all of the 13 analyzed ROIs (two-tailed paired t-test, right ACC at t(8)=4.353, p=0.0024; right amygdala, matched paired t test t(8)>3.175, p<0.013; for the remaining ROIs, t(8)=4.36, p<0.002). The template selection method also provided more reliable volume estimates than the single template method with increased ICCs. Moreover, the improved accuracy of atlas-based segmentation using optimum templates approaches the accuracy of manual tracing, and thus is valid for automated brain imaging analyses.},

abstract = {We used functional MRI (fMRI) and a network model based on graph theory to measure functional connectivity of brain motor network in the resting state in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). FMRIs were acquired in 22 PD patients before and after levodopa administration, and in age- and sex-matched normal controls. The total connectivity degree of each region within the motor network was calculated and compared between patients and controls. We found that PD patients at off state had significantly decreased functional connectivity in the supplementary motor area, left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and left putamen, and had increased functional connectivity in the left cerebellum, left primary motor cortex, and left parietal cortex compared to normal subjects. Administration of levodopa relatively normalized the pattern of functional connectivity in PD patients. The functional connectivity in most of regions in the motor network correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score in the patients. Our findings demonstrate that the pattern of functional connectivity of the motor network in the resting state is disrupted in PD. This change is secondary to dopamine deficiency, and related to the severity of the disease. We postulate that this abnormal functional connectivity of motor network in the baseline state is possibly an important factor contributing to some motor deficits in PD, e.g. akinesia.},

abstract = {Abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with prominent brain inflammation. Whereas earlier studies concluded that this inflammation is detrimental, more recent animal data suggest that at least some inflammatory processes may be beneficial and promote Abeta clearance. Consistent with these observations, overproduction of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 resulted in a vigorous microglial activation that was accompanied by at least a 50% reduction in Abeta accumulation in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. In a search for inflammatory mediators associated with this reduced pathology, we found that brain levels of C3, the central component of complement and a key inflammatory protein activated in AD, were markedly higher in hAPP/TGF-beta1 mice than in hAPP mice. To assess the importance of complement in the pathogenesis of AD-like disease in mice, we inhibited C3 activation by expressing soluble complement receptor-related protein y (sCrry), a complement inhibitor, in the brains of hAPP mice. Abeta deposition was 2- to 3-fold higher in 1-year-old hAPP/sCrry mice than in age-matched hAPP mice and was accompanied by a prominent accumulation of degenerating neurons. These results indicate that complement activation products can protect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and may reduce the accumulation or promote the clearance of amyloid and degenerating neurons. These findings provide evidence for a role of complement and innate immune responses in AD-like disease in mice and support the concept that certain inflammatory defense mechanisms in the brain may be beneficial in neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {Importance Previous postmortem studies have long demonstrated that neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are closely associated with Alzheimer disease clinical phenotype and neurodegeneration pattern. Validating these associations in vivo will lead to new diagnostic tools for Alzheimer disease and better understanding of its neurobiology. Objective To examine whether topographical distribution and severity of hyperphosphorylated tau pathologic findings measured by fluorine 18-labeled AV-1451 ([18F]AV-1451) positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging are linked with clinical phenotype and cortical atrophy in patients with Alzheimer disease. Design, Setting, and Participants This observational case series, conducted from July 1, 2012, to July 30, 2015, in an outpatient referral center for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, included 6 patients: 3 with typical amnesic Alzheimer disease and 3 with atypical variants (posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, and corticobasal syndrome). Patients underwent [18F]AV-1451 PET imaging to measure tau burden, carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C]PiB) PET imaging to measure amyloid burden, and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical thickness. Seventy-seven age-matched controls with normal cognitive function also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging but not tau or amyloid PET imaging. Main Outcomes and Measures Tau burden, amyloid burden, and cortical thickness. Results In all 6 patients (3 women and 3 men; mean age 61.8 years), the underlying clinical phenotype was associated with the regional distribution of the [18F]AV-1451 signal. Furthermore, within 68 cortical regions of interest measured from each patient, the magnitude of cortical atrophy was strongly correlated with the magnitude of [18F]AV-1451 binding (3 patients with amnesic Alzheimer disease, r = -0.82; P < .001; r = -0.70; P < .001; r = -0.58; P < .001; and 3 patients with nonamnesic Alzheimer disease, r = -0.51; P < .001; r = -0.63; P < .001; r = -0.70; P < .001), but not of [11C]PiB binding. Conclusions and Relevance These findings provide further in vivo evidence that distribution of the [18F]AV-1451 signal as seen on results of PET imaging is a valid marker of clinical symptoms and neurodegeneration. By localizing and quantifying hyperphosphorylated tau in vivo, results of tau PET imaging will likely serve as a key biomarker that links a specific type of molecular Alzheimer disease neuropathologic condition with clinically significant neurodegeneration, which will likely catalyze additional efforts to develop disease-modifying therapeutics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We wished to develop a highly selective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent targeting PHF-tau in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. METHODS: To screen potential tau binders, human AD brain sections were used as a source of native paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and A$\beta$ rather than synthetic tau aggregates or A$\beta$ fibrils generated in vitro to measure the affinity and selectivity of [(18)F]T807 to tau and A$\beta$. Brain uptake and biodistribution of [(18)F]T807 in mice were also tested. RESULTS: In vitro autoradiography results show that [(18)F]T807 exhibits strong binding to PHF-tau-positive human brain sections. A dissociation constant (Kd) of [(18)F]T807 (14.6 nM) was measured using brain sections from the frontal lobe of AD patients. A comparison of autoradiography and double immunohistochemical staining of PHF-tau and A$\beta$ on adjacent sections demonstrated that [(18)F]T807 binding colocalized with immunoreactive PHF-tau pathology, but did not highlight A$\beta$ plaques. In vivo studies in mice demonstrated that [(18)F]T807 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and washed out quickly. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]T807 demonstrates high affinity and selectivity to PHF-tau as well as favorable in vivo properties, making this a promising candidate as an imaging agent for AD.},

abstract = {One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the extracellular space in the brain. Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of aggregated amyloid $\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$), a proteolytic fragment of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). For APP to be proteolytically cleaved into A$\beta$, it must be internalized into the cell and trafficked to endosomes where specific protease complexes can cleave APP. Several recent genome-wide association studies have reported that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) gene were significantly associated with Alzheimer disease, suggesting a role in APP endocytosis and A$\beta$ generation. Here, we show that PICALM co-localizes with APP in intracellular vesicles of N2a-APP cells after endocytosis is initiated. PICALM knockdown resulted in reduced APP internalization and A$\beta$ generation. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased APP internalization and A$\beta$ production. In vivo, PICALM was found to be expressed in neurons and co-localized with APP throughout the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. PICALM expression was altered using AAV8 gene transfer of PICALM shRNA or PICALM cDNA into the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. PICALM knockdown decreased soluble and insoluble A$\beta$ levels and amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased A$\beta$ levels and amyloid plaque load. These data indicate that PICALM, an adaptor protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, regulates APP internalization and subsequent A$\beta$ generation. PICALM contributes to amyloid plaque load in brain likely via its effect on A$\beta$ metabolism.},

As a first example, neuronal pathways in the rat brain were probed. Eight well-known fiber projections; genu and splenium of corpus callosum, internal and external capsule, fimbria, anterior commissure, optic tract, and stria terminalis were tracked and shown to be in agreement with the location of these known axonal projections.

abstract = {Tau is primarily a cytoplasmic protein that stabilizes microtubules. However, it is also found in the extracellular space of the brain at appreciable concentrations. Although its presence there may be relevant to the intercellular spread of tau pathology, the cellular mechanisms regulating tau release into the extracellular space are not well understood. To test this in the context of neuronal networks in vivo, we used in vivo microdialysis. Increasing neuronal activity rapidly increased the steady-state levels of extracellular tau in vivo. Importantly, presynaptic glutamate release is sufficient to drive tau release. Although tau release occurred within hours in response to neuronal activity, the elimination rate of tau from the extracellular compartment and the brain is slow (half-life of ∼11 d). The in vivo results provide one mechanism underlying neuronal tau release and may link trans-synaptic spread of tau pathology with synaptic activity itself.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to test the feasibility of the tractography technique based on diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) for the assessment of small infarcts involving the brainstem. METHODS: A patient who presented with an isolated left third cranial nerve palsy underwent magnetic resonance examination. Images were obtained by use of a whole-body, 1.5-T imager. Data were transferred to an off-line workstation for fiber tracking. RESULTS: The conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) performed using a 5 mm slice thickness could only depict an equivocal hyperintensity lesion located at the left paramedian midbrain. An additional thin-slice DTI was performed immediately after the initial DWI using a 3 mm slice thickness and was able to delineate the lesion more clearly. Image postprocessing of thin-slice DTI data revealed that the lesion location involved the course of the third cranial nerve tract, corresponding with the patient's clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The tractography technique can be applied to assess fine neuronal structures of the brainstem, enabling direct clinicoradiological correlation of small infarcts involving this region.},

abstract = {Amyloid beta-protein (A beta), the principal constituent of senile plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived by proteolysis from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta PP). The mechanism of A beta production in neurons, which are hypothesized to be a rich source of A beta in brain, remains to be defined. In this study, we describe a detailed localization of cell surface beta PP and its subsequent trafficking in primary cultured neurons. Full-length cell surface beta PP was present primarily on perikarya and axons, the latter with a characteristic discontinuous pattern. At growth cones, cell surface beta PP was inconsistently detected. By visualizing the distribution of beta PP monoclonal antibodies added to intact cultures, beta PP was shown to be internalized from distal axons or terminals and retrogradely transported back to perikarya in organelles which colocalized with fluid-phase endocytic markers. Retrograde transport of beta PP was shown in both hippocampal and peripheral sympathetic neurons, the latter using a compartment culture system that isolated cell bodies from distal axons and terminals. In addition, we demonstrated that beta PP from distal axons was transcytotically transported to the surface of perikarya from distal axons in sympathetic neurons. Indirect evidence of this transcytotic pathway was obtained in hippocampal neurons using antisense oligonucleotide to the kinesin heavy chain to inhibit anterograde beta PP transport. Taken together, these results demonstrate novel aspects of beta PP trafficking in neurons, including retrograde axonal transport and transcytosis. Moreover, the axonal predominance of cell surface beta PP is unexpected in view of the recent report of polarized sorting of beta PP to the basolateral domain of MDCK cells.},

abstract = {Tau tangles are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) with strong correlations existing between tau aggregation and cognitive decline. Studies in mouse models have shown that the characteristic patterns of tau spatial spread associated with AD progression are determined by neural connectivity rather than physical proximity between different brain regions. We present here a network diffusion model for tau aggregation based on longitudinal tau measures from positron emission tomography (PET) and structural connectivity graphs from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). White matter fiber bundles reconstructed via tractography from the DTI data were used to compute normalized graph Laplacians which served as graph diffusion kernels for tau spread. By linearizing this model and using sparse source localization, we were able to identify distinct patterns of propagative and generative buildup of tau at a population level. A gradient descent approach was used to solve the sparsity-constrained optimization problem. Model fitting was performed on subjects from the Harvard Aging Brain Study cohort. The fitted model parameters include a scalar factor controlling the network-based tau spread and a network-independent seed vector representing seeding in different regions-of-interest. This parametric model was validated on an independent group of subjects from the same cohort. We were able to predict with reasonably high accuracy the tau buildup at a future time-point. The network diffusion model, therefore, successfully identifies two distinct mechanisms for tau buildup in the aging brain and offers a macroscopic perspective on tau spread.},

abstract = {Aging is one of the most important biological processes and is a known risk factor for many age-related diseases in human. Studying age-related transcriptomic changes in tissues across the whole body can provide valuable information for a holistic understanding of this fundamental process. In this work, we catalogue age-related gene expression changes in nine tissues from nearly two hundred individuals collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In general, we find the aging gene expression signatures are very tissue specific. However, enrichment for some well-known aging components such as mitochondria biology is observed in many tissues. Different levels of cross-tissue synchronization of age-related gene expression changes are observed and some essential tissues (e.g., heart and lung) show much stronger “co-aging” than other tissues based on a principal component analysis. The aging gene signatures and complex disease genes show a complex overlapping pattern and only in some cases, we see that they are significantly overlapped in the tissues affected by the corresponding diseases. In summary, our analyses provide novel insights to the co-regulation of age-related gene expression in multiple tissues; it also presents a tissue-specific view of the link between aging and age-related diseases.},

abstract = {Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and structural imaging markers are suggested as biomarkers amended to existing diagnostic criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). But there is no clear instruction on which markers should be used at which stage of dementia. This study aimed to first investigate associations of the CSF markers as well as volumes and shapes of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles with MCI and AD at the baseline and secondly apply these baseline markers to predict MCI conversion in a two-year time using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results suggested that the CSF markers, including A$\beta$42, t-tau, and p-tau, distinguished MCI or AD from NC, while the A$\beta$42 CSF marker contributed to the differentiation between MCI and AD. The hippocampal shapes performed better than the hippocampal volumes in classifying NC and MCI, NC and AD, as well as MCI and AD. Interestingly, the ventricular volumes were better than the ventricular shapes to distinguish MCI or AD from NC, while the ventricular shapes showed better accuracy than the ventricular volumes in classifying MCI and AD. As the CSF markers and the structural markers are complementary, the combination of them showed great improvements in the classification accuracies of MCI and AD. Moreover, the combination of these markers showed high sensitivity but low specificity for predicting conversion from MCI to AD in two years. Hence, it is feasible to employ a cross-sectional sample to investigate dynamic associations of the CSF and imaging markers with MCI and AD and to predict future MCI conversion. In particular, the volumetric information may be good for the early stage of AD, while morphological shapes should be considered as markers in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD together with the CSF markers.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to determine diffusion abnormalities in the uncinate fasciculus (UF) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) using a new method for measuring the core of the tract. METHODS: We studied 19 patients with AD and 19 age-matched control subjects who underwent MRI using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of the UF was generated. The mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the core of the tract were measured after voxelized tract shape processing. Student's t-test was used to compare results between patients with AD and controls. Intraobserver correlation tests were also performed. RESULTS: FA was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the UF of patients with AD than of controls. There was no significant difference in MD along the UF between the two groups. Intraobserver reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) for the first and second measurement was r > 0.93 for measured FA and r > 0.92 for measured MD. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that FA reflects progression of AD-related histopathological changes in the UF of the white matter and may represent a useful biological index in monitoring AD. Diffusion tensor tract-specific analysis with voxelized tract shape processing to measure the core of the tract may be a sensitive tool for evaluation of diffusion abnormalities of white matter tracts in AD.},

abstract = {Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have "prodromal or incipient" dementia with neuropathological changes. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) binding was shown to reflect activated microglia, one of the predictive biomarkers of conversion to dementia. We sought to evaluate PBR binding in MCI subjects using positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans with [¹¹C]DAA1106, a potent and selective ligand for PBR, were performed on seven MCI subjects, 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 age-matched control subjects. PBR binding in the regions of interest was quantified by binding potential (BP). Five MCI subjects were clinically followed for 5 years after their initial PET scans. [¹¹C]DAA1106 binding to PBR was significantly increased in widespread areas in MCI subjects when compared to healthy controls. We found no significant difference in BP between MCI and AD patients. MCI subjects with [¹¹C]DAA1106 binding values higher than the control mean +0.5 standard deviation (S.D.) developed dementia within 5 years. Our finding of higher DAA binding in MCI subjects indicated that microglial activation may occur before the onset of dementia. In vivo detection of microglial activation may provide useful prognostic information with respect to stratifying MCI subjects at increased risk of dementia.},

abstract = {Despite all scientific efforts and many protracted and expensive clinical trials, no new drug has been approved by FDA for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) since 2003. Indeed, more than 200 investigational programs have failed or have been abandoned in the last decade. The most probable explanations for failures of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for AD may include late initiation of treatments during the course of AD development, inappropriate drug dosages, erroneous selection of treatment targets, and mainly an inadequate understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AD, which may necessitate combination treatments rather than monotherapy. Clinical trials' methodological issues have also been criticized. Drug-development research for AD is aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Preclinical and prodromal AD populations, as well as traditionally investigated populations representing all the clinical stages of AD, are included in recent trials. Systematic use of biomarkers in staging preclinical and prodromal AD and of a single primary outcome in trials of prodromal AD are regularly integrated. The application of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers, including new biomarkers—such as Tau positron emission tomography, neurofilament light chain (blood and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of axonal degeneration) and neurogranin (CSF biomarker of synaptic functioning)—to clinical trials allows more precise staging of AD. Additionally, use of Bayesian statistics, modifiable clinical trial designs, and clinical trial simulators enrich the trial methodology. Besides, combination therapy regimens are assessed in clinical trials. The above-mentioned diagnostic and statistical advances, which have been recently integrated in clinical trials, are relevant to the recent failures of studies of disease-modifying treatments. Their experiential rather than theoretical origins may better equip potentially successful drug-development strategies.},

abstract = {Fibrillization or conformational change of alpha-synuclein is central in the pathogenesis of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson disease. We found that the A30P mutant accelerates nucleation-dependent fibrillization of wild type (WT) alpha-synuclein. Electron microscopy observation and ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that shedding of fragments occurs from A30P fibrils and that these fragments accelerate fibrillization by serving as seeds. Immunochemical analysis using epitope-specific antibodies and biochemical analyses of protease-resistant cores demonstrated that A30P fibrils have a distinct conformation. Interestingly, WT fibrils formed with A30P seeds exhibited the same character as A30P fibrils, as did A30P fibrils formed with WT seeds, indicating that the A30P mutation affects the conformation and fibrillization of both WT and A30P. These effects of A30P mutation may explain the apparent conflict between the association of A30P with Parkinson disease and the slow fibrillization of A30P itself and therefore provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of alpha-synucleinopathies.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-$\beta$1-42 < 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-$\beta$1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-$\beta$1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 × 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.},

abstract = {Haplodeficiency of the microglia gene TREM2 increases risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the mechanisms remain uncertain. To investigate this, we used high-resolution confocal and super-resolution (STORM) microscopy in AD-like mice and human AD tissue. We found that microglia processes, rich in TREM2, tightly surround early amyloid fibrils and plaques promoting their compaction and insulation. In Trem2- or DAP12-haplodeficient mice and in humans with R47H TREM2 mutations, microglia had a markedly reduced ability to envelop amyloid deposits. This led to an increase in less compact plaques with longer and branched amyloid fibrils resulting in greater surface exposure to adjacent neurites. This was associated with more severe neuritic tau hyperphosphorylation and axonal dystrophy around amyloid deposits. Thus, TREM2 deficiency may disrupt the formation of a neuroprotective microglia barrier that regulates amyloid compaction and insulation. Pharmacological modulation of this barrier could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is proposed that alpha-synucleinopathy (AS) initially affects the medulla oblongata and progresses to more rostral brain areas in a hierarchical sequence ("Braak hypothesis"). Predominant involvement of the amygdala is also described. This study examines the applicability of these patterns, and their relationship to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, in brains of a population-based donor cohort. METHODS: Brains donated in two of six Cognitive Function and Ageing Study cohorts (Cambridgeshire and Nottingham) were examined. More than 80% were older than 80 years at death. The respondents were evaluated prospectively in life for cognitive decline and dementia. Immunocytochemistry for tau and alpha-synuclein was carried out in 208 brains to establish Braak stage and the pattern and severity of AS. RESULTS: Seventy-six brains showed Lewy bodies. Half (51%) conformed to the Braak hypothesis while 17% had pathology in a higher region which was absent in a lower region. A further 29% showed amygdala-predominant pathology. Six brains showed predominant neocortical pathology with minimal pathology in amygdala or substantia nigra. The stage of AD pathology was not associated with particular patterns of AS. CONCLUSION: alpha-Synucleinopathy (AS) is common in older people, and frequently associated with Alzheimer disease-type pathology. Although half of brains corresponded to the Braak hypothesis, and 29% to amygdala-predominant AS, there were a high proportion of cases which did not fit a staging system. An unexpectedly high proportion with a cortical form of Lewy body disease was identified.},

The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison of 18F-GE180 and the well-established TSPO tracer 11C-PBR28 by scanning with both tracers during the same day in the same subjects. Methods: Five subjects underwent a 90-min PET scan with 11C-PBR28 in the morning and 18F-GE180 in the afternoon. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was obtained in each subject for both tracers, and the brain uptake was quantified with a 2-tissue-compartment model. Results: The rate of metabolism of 18F-GE180 in arterial blood was slower than that of 11C-PBR28 (the percentages of nonmetabolized parent in plasma at 90 min were 74.9% ± 4.15% [mean ± SD] and 11.2% ± 1.90%, respectively). The plasma free fractions were similar for both tracers: 3.5% ± 1.1% for 18F-GE180 and 4.1% ± 1.1% for 11C-PBR28. The average total volume of distribution (VT) of 18F-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of 11C-PBR28 (0.15 ± 0.03 mL/cm3 for 18F-GE180 and 3.27 ± 0.66 mL/cm3 for 11C-PBR28). 18F-GE180 was characterized by poor transfer from the vascular compartment to the brain (its plasma-to-tissue rate constant [K1] was about 10 times smaller than that of 11C-PBR28). Moreover, kinetic modeling was more difficult with 18F-GE180, as its VT values were identified with a lower precision than those of 11C-PBR28 and outlying values were more frequent. Conclusion: The VT of 18F-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of 11C-PBR28 because of low penetration into the brain from the vascular compartment. In addition, kinetic modeling of 18F-GE180 was more challenging than that of 11C-PBR28. Therefore, compared with 11C-PBR28, 18F-GE180 had unfavorable characteristics for TSPO imaging of the brain.},

abstract = {Background: Commonly used neuroimaging biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) are useful for diagnosis but poor at predicting outcomes. We explored whether an atrophy pattern from whole-brain structural MRI, measured in the drug-na{\"{i}}ve early stage, could predict PD prognosis. Methods: 362 de novo PD patients with T1-weighted MRI (n = 222 for the main analysis, 140 for the validation analysis) were recruited from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We investigated a previously identified PD-specific network atrophy pattern as a potential biomarker of disease severity and prognosis. Progression trajectories of motor function (MDS-UPDRS-part III), cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)), and a global composite outcome measure were compared between atrophy tertiles using mixed effect models. The prognostic value of the MRI atrophy measure was compared with 123I ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography, the postural-instability-gait-disturbance score, and cerebrospinal fluid markers. Findings: After 4.5 years follow-up, PD-specific atrophy network score at baseline significantly predicted change in UPDRS-part III (r = −0.197, p =.003), MoCA (r = 0.253, p =.0002) and global composite outcome (r = −0.249, p =.0002). Compared with the 3rd tertile (i.e. least atrophy), the tertile with the highest baseline atrophy (i.e. the 1st tertile) had a 3-point annual faster progression in UPDRS-part III (p =.012), faster worsening of posture-instability gait scores (+0.21 further annual increase, p <.0001), faster decline in MoCA (−0.74 further annual decline in MoCA, p =.0372) and a + 0.38 (p =.0029) faster annual increase in the global composite z-score. All findings were replicated in a validation analysis using 1.5T MRI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed the superiority of the MRI biomarker, although it had modest AUC values (0.63). By comparison, the other biomarkers were limited in their ability to predict prognosis either in the main or validation analysis. Interpretation: A PD-specific network atrophy pattern predicts progression of motor, cognitive, and global outcome in PD, and is a better predictor of prognosis than any of the other tested biomarkers. Therefore, it has potential as a prognostic biomarker for clinical trials of early PD.},

The degree of atrophy reflected clinical measures of disease severity. The spatial pattern of atrophy demonstrated overlap with intrinsic networks present in healthy brain, as derived from functional MRI. Moreover, the degree of atrophy in each brain region reflected its functional and anatomical proximity to a presumed disease epicenter in the substantia nigra, compatible with a trans-neuronal spread of the disease. These results support a network-spread mechanism in PD. Finally, the atrophy pattern in PD was also seen in healthy aging, where it also correlated with the loss of striatal dopaminergic innervation.},

abstract = {The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of the adult mouse nervous system uncovers new cell classes and types across regions, providing a clearer picture of cell diversity by region and a reference atlas for studying the mammalian nervous system.},

abstract = {Subcellular mislocalization of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Six Tau isoforms, differentiated by the presence or absence of a second repeat or of N-terminal inserts, exist in the human CNS, but their physiological and pathological differences have long remained elusive. Here, we investigated the properties and distributions of human and rodent Tau isoforms in primary forebrain rodent neurons. We found that the Tau diffusion barrier (TDB), located within the axon initial segment (AIS), controls retrograde (axon-to-soma) and anterograde (soma-to-axon) traffic of Tau. Tau isoforms without the N-terminal inserts were sorted efficiently into the axon. However, the longest isoform (2N4R-Tau) was partially retained in cell bodies and dendrites, where it accelerated spine and dendrite growth. The TDB (located within the AIS) was impaired when AIS components (ankyrin G, EB1) were knocked down or when glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; an AD-associated kinase tethered to the AIS) was overexpressed. Using superresolution nanoscopy and live-cell imaging, we observed that microtubules within the AIS appeared highly dynamic, a feature essential for the TDB. Pathomechanistically, amyloid- insult caused cofilin activation and F-actin remodeling and decreased microtubule dynamics in the AIS. Concomitantly with these amyloid-–induced disruptions, the AIS/TDB sorting function failed, causing AD-like Tau missorting. In summary, we provide evidence that the human and rodent Tau isoforms differ in axodendritic sorting and amyloid-–induced missorting and that the axodendritic distribution of Tau depends on AIS integrity.},

It was also hypothesized that there is an association between diffusion abnormality and PD severity and subtype. Diffusion tensor imaging at 4 Tesla was obtained in 12 PD and 20 control subjects, and measures of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were evaluated using both region-of-interest and voxel-based methods. Movement deficits and subtypes in PD subjects were assessed using the Motor Subscale (Part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Reduced fractional anisotropy (P < .05, corrected) was found in PD subjects in regions related to the precentral gyrus, substantia nigra, putamen, posterior striatum, frontal lobe, and the supplementary motor areas. Reduced fractional anisotropy in the substantia nigra correlated (P < .05, corrected) with the increased rating scale motor scores. Significant spatial correlations between fractional anisotropy alterations in the putamen and other PD-affected regions were also found in the context of PD subtypes index analysis. Our data suggest that microstructural alterations detected with diffusion tensor might serve as a potential biomarker for PD.},

White matter tractography using sequential importance sampling. In: Proceedings of the ISMRM Annual Meeting, p. 1131] and Bjornemo et al. [Bjornemo, M., Brun, A., Kikinis, R., Westin, C.F., 2002. Regularized stochastic white matter tractography using diffusion tensor MRI, In: Proc. MICCAI, pp. 435-442]. However, these previous attempts have not utilised the full power of the technique, and as a result the fiber paths were tracked in a goal directed way. In this paper, we provide an advanced technique by presenting a fast and novel probabilistic method for white matter fiber tracking in diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), which takes advantage of the weighting and resampling mechanism of particle filtering. We formulate fiber tracking using a non-linear state space model which captures both smoothness regularity of the fibers and the uncertainties in the local fiber orientations due to noise and partial volume effects. Global fiber tracking is then posed as a problem of particle filtering. To model the posterior distribution, we classify voxels of the white matter as either prolate or oblate tensors. We then construct the orientation distributions for prolate and oblate tensors separately. Finally, the importance density function for particle filtering is modeled using the von Mises-Fisher distribution on a unit sphere. Fast and efficient sampling is achieved using Ulrich-Wood's simulation algorithm. Given a seed point, the method is able to rapidly locate the globally optimal fiber and also provides a probability map for potential connections. The proposed method is validated and compared to alternative methods both on synthetic data and real-world brain MRI datasets.},

abstract = {A mammalian brain is composed of numerous cell types organized in an intricate manner to form functional neural circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows systematic identification of cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain 1,2 . Single-cell epigenomic profiling 3,4 further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation. Here we used a single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) 5 , to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex. We profiled approximately 300,000 cells in the mouse primary motor cortex and its adjacent areas, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted laminar organizations. Intratelencephalic neurons formed a largely continuous gradient along the cortical depth axis, in which the gene expression of individual cells correlated with their cortical depths. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde labelling to probe projection targets of neurons of the mouse primary motor cortex and found that their cortical projections formed a complex network in which individual neuronal clusters project to multiple target regions and individual target regions receive inputs from multiple neuronal clusters.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that an inflammatory process in the substantia nigra, characterized by activation of resident microglia, likely either initiates or aggravates nigral neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). To study the mechanisms by which nigral microglia are activated in PD, the potential role of alpha-synuclein (a major component of Lewy bodies that can cause neurodegeneration when aggregated) in microglial activation was investigated. The results demonstrated that in a primary mesencephalic neuron-glia culture system, extracellular aggregated human alpha-synuclein indeed activated microglia; microglial activation enhanced dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by aggregated alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, microglial enhancement of alpha-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity depended on phagocytosis of alpha-synuclein and activation of NADPH oxidase with production of reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that nigral neuronal damage, regardless of etiology, may release aggregated alpha-synuclein into substantia nigra, which activates microglia with production of proinflammatory mediators, thereby leading to persistent and progressive nigral neurodegeneration in PD. Finally, NADPH oxidase could be an ideal target for potential pharmaceutical intervention, given that it plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein-mediated microglial activation and associated neurotoxicity.},

However, it is unclear whether these abnormalities also impact the cingulum fibers, which connect the medial temporal lobe and the posterior cingulate regions. OBJECTIVE: To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), by measuring fractional anisotropy (FA), to test 1) if MCI and AD are associated with DTI abnormalities in the parahippocampal and posterior cingulate regions of the cingulum fibers; 2) if white matter abnormalities extend to the neocortical fiber connections in the corpus callosum (CC); 3) if DTI improves accuracy to separate AD and MCI from healthy aging vs structural MRI. METHODS: DTI and structural MRI were preformed on 17 patients with AD, 17 with MCI, and 18 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. RESULTS: FA of the cingulum fibers was significantly reduced in MCI, and even more in AD. FA was also significantly reduced in the splenium of the CC in AD, but not in MCI. Adding DTI to hippocampal volume significantly improved the accuracy to separate MCI and AD from CN. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the cingulum fibers using diffusion tensor imaging may aid early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {The identification of clinical and biological markers of disease in persons at risk for Huntington disease (HD) has increased in efforts to better quantify and characterize the epoch of prodrome prior to clinical diagnosis. Such efforts are critical in the design and implementation of clinical trials for HD so that interventions can occur at a time most likely to increase neuronal survival and maximize daily functioning. A prime consideration in the examination of prodromal individuals is their proximity to diagnosis. It is necessary to quantify proximity so that individual differences in key marker variables can be properly interpreted. We take a data-driven approach to develop an index that can be viewed as a proxy for time to HD diagnosis known as the CAG-Age Product Scaled or CAPS. CAPS is an observed utility variable computed for all genetically at-risk individuals based on age at study entry and CAG repeat length. Results of a longitudinal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that CAPS had a relatively strong ability to predict individuals who became diagnosed, especially in the first 2 years. Bootstrap validation provided evidence that CAPS computed on a new sample from the same population could have similar discriminatory power. Cutoffs for the empirical CAPS distribution can be used to create a classification for mutation-positive individuals (Low-Med-High), which is, useful for comparison with the naturally occurring mutation-negative Control group. The classification is an improvement over the one currently in use as it is based on observed data rather than model-based estimated values. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Twenty AD, 20 FTD patients, and 21 healthy control subjects were imaged using a 4 Tesla MRI. GM loss and GM hypoperfusion were measured using high-resolution T1 and arterial spin labeling MRI (ASL-MRI). WM degradation was measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Using a new analytical approach, the study found greater WM degenerations in FTD than AD at mild abnormality levels. Furthermore, the GM loss and WM degeneration exceeded the reduced perfusion in FTD whereas, in AD, structural and functional damages were similar. Joint assessments of multimodal MRI have potential value to provide new imaging markers for improved differential diagnoses between FTD and AD.},

abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease are sometimes difficult to differentiate clinically because of overlapping symptoms. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) can be useful in distinguishing the different patterns of white matter degradation between the two dementias. In this study, we performed MRI scans in a 4 Tesla MRI machine including T1-weighted structural images and diffusion tensor images in 18 patients with FTD, 18 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 19 cognitively normal (CN) controls. FA was measured selectively in specific fibre tracts (including corpus callosum, cingulum, uncinate and corticospinal tracts) as well as globally in a voxel-by-voxel analysis. Patients with FTD were associated with reductions of FA in frontal and temporal regions including the anterior corpus callosum (P < 0.001), bilateral anterior (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.005), descending (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.003) cingulum tracts, and uncinate tracts (left P < 0.001; right P = 0.005), compared to controls. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were associated with reductions of FA in parietal, temporal and frontal regions including the left anterior (P = 0.003) and posterior (P = 0.002) cingulum tracts, bilateral descending cingulum tracts (P < 0.001) and left uncinate tracts (P < 0.001) compared to controls. When compared with Alzheimer's disease, FTD was associated with greater reductions of FA in frontal brain regions, whereas no region in Alzheimer's disease showed greater reductions of FA when compared to FTD. In conclusion, the regional patterns of anisotropy reduction in FTD and Alzheimer's disease compared to controls suggest a characteristic distribution of white matter degradation in each disease. Moreover, the white matter degradation seems to be more prominent in FTD than in Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, the results suggest that white matter degradation measured with DTI may improve the diagnostic differentiation between FTD and Alzheimer's disease.},

The depletion of these neurons is thought to reduce the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway, as well as the neural fibers that link the substantia nigra to the striatum (putamen and caudate), causing a dysregulation in striatal activity that ultimately leads to lack of movement control. Based on diffusion tensor imaging, visualizing this pathway and measuring alterations of the fiber integrity remain challenging. The objectives were to 1) develop a diffusion tensor tractography protocol for reliably tracking the nigrostriatal fibers on multicenter data; 2) test whether the integrities measured by diffusion tensor imaging of the nigrostriatal fibers are abnormal in PD; and 3) test whether abnormal integrities of the nigrostriatal fibers in PD patients are associated with the severity of motor disability and putaminal dopamine binding ratios.

METHODS: Diffusion tensor tractography was performed on 50 drug-na{\"{i}}ve PD patients and 27 healthy control subjects from the international multicenter Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative.

RESULTS: Tractography consistently detected the nigrostriatal fibers, yielding reliable diffusion measures. Fractional anisotropy, along with radial and axial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract, showed systematic abnormalities in patients. In addition, variations in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity of the nigrostriatal tract were associated with the degree of motor deficits in PD patients.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, the findings imply that the diffusion tensor imaging characteristic of the nigrostriatal tract is potentially an index for detecting and staging of early PD. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia throughout the world. It is characterized by major amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are composed of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptide and hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), respectively. Exosomes, which are secreted by cells, are single-membrane lipid bilayer vesicles found in bodily fluids and they have a diameter of 30–150 nm. Recently, they have been considered as critical carriers and biomarkers in AD, as they facilitate communication between cells and tissues by delivering proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. This review demonstrates that exosomes are natural nanocontainers that carry APP as well as Tau cleavage products secreted by neuronal cells and that their formation is associated with the endosomal–lysosomal pathway. Moreover, these exosomes can transfer AD pathological molecules and participate in the pathophysiological process of AD; therefore, they have potential diagnostic and therapeutic value for AD and might also provide novel insights for screening and prevention of the disease.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale neural networks. Four competing mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain network-based disease patterning: nodal stress, transneuronal spread, trophic failure, and shared vulnerability. Here, we used task-free fMRI to derive the healthy intrinsic connectivity patterns seeded by brain regions vulnerable to any of five distinct neurodegenerative diseases. These data enabled us to investigate how intrinsic connectivity in health predicts region-by-region vulnerability to disease. For each illness, specific regions emerged as critical network "epicenters" whose normal connectivity profiles most resembled the disease-associated atrophy pattern. Graph theoretical analyses in healthy subjects revealed that regions with higher total connectional flow and, more consistently, shorter functional paths to the epicenters, showed greater disease-related vulnerability. These findings best fit a transneuronal spread model of network-based vulnerability. Molecular pathological approaches may help clarify what makes each epicenter vulnerable to its targeting disease and how toxic protein species travel between networked brain structures.},

abstract = {Resting-state or intrinsic connectivity network functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a new tool for mapping large-scale neural network function and dysfunction. Recently, we showed that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease cause atrophy within two major networks, an anterior 'Salience Network' (atrophied in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia) and a posterior 'Default Mode Network' (atrophied in Alzheimer's disease). These networks exhibit an anti-correlated relationship with each other in the healthy brain. The two diseases also feature divergent symptom-deficit profiles, with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia undermining social-emotional function and preserving or enhancing visuospatial skills, and Alzheimer's disease showing the inverse pattern. We hypothesized that these disorders would exert opposing connectivity effects within the Salience Network (disrupted in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia but enhanced in Alzheimer's disease) and the Default Mode Network (disrupted in Alzheimer's disease but enhanced in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia). With task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested these ideas in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12 per group), using independent component analyses to generate group-level network contrasts. As predicted, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia attenuated Salience Network connectivity, most notably in frontoinsular, cingulate, striatal, thalamic and brainstem nodes, but enhanced connectivity within the Default Mode Network. Alzheimer's disease, in contrast, reduced Default Mode Network connectivity to posterior hippocampus, medial cingulo-parieto-occipital regions and the dorsal raphe nucleus, but intensified Salience Network connectivity. Specific regions of connectivity disruption within each targeted network predicted intrinsic connectivity enhancement within the reciprocal network. In behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, clinical severity correlated with loss of right frontoinsular Salience Network connectivity and with biparietal Default Mode Network connectivity enhancement. Based on these results, we explored whether a combined index of Salience Network and Default Mode Network connectivity might discriminate between the three groups. Linear discriminant analysis achieved 92% clinical classification accuracy, including 100% separation of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Patients whose clinical diagnoses were supported by molecular imaging, genetics, or pathology showed 100% separation using this method, including four diagnostically equivocal 'test' patients not used to train the algorithm. Overall, the findings suggest that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease lead to divergent network connectivity patterns, consistent with known reciprocal network interactions and the strength and deficit profiles of the two disorders. Further developed, intrinsic connectivity network signatures may provide simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive biomarkers for dementia differential diagnosis and disease monitoring.},

abstract = {Increased expression of interleukin-1 in Alzheimer disease (AD) has been implicated as a driving force in neurodegenerative cascades that underlie the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the spread of these neuropathological lesions across cerebral cortical regions, and the accompanying neuronal cell injury and loss. The beta isoform of interleukin-1 is generated from an inactive, 33-kDa precursor through the action of a specific interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE), also known as caspase-1. We used mesial temporal tissue (hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex) obtained postmortem from Alzheimer and control patients for determinations of endogenous tissue ICE activity and for Western immunoblot analysis of tissue ICE concentrations. ICE activity in Alzheimer tissue was elevated 50-100% (p < 0.002, or better, at incubation times of 30 min to 10 h), and ICE protein level was elevated 180% (p = 0.01). Parahippocampal cortex of Alzheimer patients showed increased numbers of neurons with in situ evidence of DNA damage. Increased DNA degradation was also evident upon electrophoresis of isolated DNA. Overexpression and increased activity of ICE may contribute to neurodegeneration in AD through generation of biologically active interleukin-1, with consequent activation of interleukin-1-driven neurodegenerative cascades.},

abstract = {Neurodegeneration, induced by misfolded tau protein, and neuroinflammation, driven by glial cells, represent the salient features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related human tauopathies. While tau neurodegeneration significantly correlates with disease progression, brain inflammation seems to be an important factor in regulating the resistance or susceptibility to AD neurodegeneration. Previously, it has been shown that there is a reciprocal relationship between the local inflammatory response and neurofibrillary lesions. Numerous independent studies have reported that inflammatory responses may contribute to the development of tau pathology and thus accelerate the course of disease. It has been shown that various cytokines can significantly affect the functional and structural properties of intracellular tau. Notwithstanding, anti-inflammatory approaches have not unequivocally demonstrated that inhibition of the brain immune response can lead to reduction of neurofibrillary lesions. On the other hand, our recent data show that misfolded tau could represent a trigger for microglial activation, suggesting the dual role of misfolded tau in the Alzheimer's disease inflammatory cascade. On the basis of current knowledge, we can conclude that misfolded tau is located at the crossroad of the neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory pathways. Thus disease-modified tau represents an important target for potential therapeutic strategies for patients with Alzheimer's disease.},

Accordingly, organotypic hippocampal rat slices were vitrified under high pressure and controlled cryoprotection conditions, cryosectioned at a final thickness of ≈70 nm and observed below -17O°C in a transmission electron microscope. The general aspect of the tissue compares with previous electron microscopy observations. The detailed analysis of the synapse reveals that the density of material in the synaptic cleft is high, even higher than in the cytoplasm, and that it is organized in 8.2-nm periodic transcleft complexes.

abstract = {Neurotrophic factors are essential contributors to the survival of peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) neurons, and demonstration of their reduced availability in diseased brains indicates that they play a role in various neurological disorders. This paper will concentrate on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the survival and activity of the neurons that die in Huntington's disease (HD) by reviewing the evidence indicating that it involves profound changes in BDNF levels and that attempts to restore these levels are therapeutically interesting. BDNF is a small dimeric protein that is widely expressed in adult mammalian brain and has been shown to promote the survival of all major neuronal types affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, cortical BDNF production is required for the correct activity of the corticostriatal synapse and the survival of the GABA-ergic medium-sized spiny striatal neurons that die in HD. We will highlight the available data concerning changes in BDNF levels in HD cells, mice and human postmortem samples, describe the molecular evidence underlying this alteration, and review the data concerning the impact of the experimental manipulation of BDNF levels on HD progression. Such studies have revealed a major loss of BDNF protein in the striatum of HD patients which may contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease. They have also opened up a molecular window into the underlying pathogenic mechanism and new therapeutic perspectives by raising the possibility that one of the mechanisms triggering the reduction in BDNF in HD may also affect the activity of many other neuronal proteins. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed interactions between psychosocial predictors, and with APOE $\epsilon$4 status. Results: Greater number of stressful events was associated with poorer performance on tests of speed and flexibility. Greater social support was associated with better performance in the same domain; this relationship was diminished by the presence of the $\epsilon$4 allele. No associations were seen in the remaining three domains. Discussion: Psychosocial factors may influence cognition in at-risk individuals; influence varies by cognitive domain and $\epsilon$4 status.},
